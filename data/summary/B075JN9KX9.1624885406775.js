But where there's life, there's hope. I had a family, I had friends, and I had the chance at a future. </p> <p>All I had to do was find a cure before I became one of the undead, destroy the maniacs after me and my boss, and life would be peachy, right? </p> <p>Wrong. </p> <p>The need to feed becomes irresistible, family get dragged into my mess, and then a new set of problems present themselves that test me to my limits, and beyond. </p> <p>I gotta admit, I'm this close to just jacking it all in and letting this infection win. </p> <p>At least then there will be peace. No pain. No hurt. No disappointment. </p> <p>Hi, I'm Faz Pound, and I'm having a bad life. </p>";
