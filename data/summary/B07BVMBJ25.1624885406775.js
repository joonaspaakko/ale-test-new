As I have inherited certain...abilities with my odd genetics, I've put them to use as Chicago's foremost paranormal investigator.</p> <p>My current case? Well, I have to admit, it feels a little personal. I'm helping a mysterious girl who's turned up on my doorstep, pregnant through mystic means. I can't help but think of my own mother...and if I don't help her, she'll face the same fate.</p> <p>Turns out, someone is trying to create an army of half-demons. While it might be a pleasant change to hang out with my own kind, I know most half-demons don't have my sense of morality. If I don't stop this evil plan, the armistice between Heaven and Hell will be broken and all of the Earth will pay...it will be the beginning of the end.</p>";
