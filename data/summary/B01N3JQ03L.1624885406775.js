Grant. </p> <p>In the near future of Robert Charles Wilson's <i>Last Year</i>, the technology exists to open doorways into the past - but not our past, not exactly. Each \"past\" is effectively an alternate world, identical to ours but only up to the date on which we access it. And a given \"past\" can be reached only once. After a passageway is open, it's the only road to that particular past; once closed, it can't be reopened. </p> <p>A passageway has been opened to a version of late 19th-century Ohio. It's been in operation for most of a decade, but it's no secret on either side of time. A small city has grown up around it to entertain visitors from our time, and many locals earn a good living catering to them. But like all such operations, it has a shelf life; as the \"natives\" become more sophisticated, their version of the \"past\" grows less attractive as a destination. </p> <p>Jesse Cullum is a native. And he knows the passageway will be closing soon. He's fallen in love with a woman from our time, and he means to follow her back - no matter whose secrets he has to expose in order to do it. </p>";
