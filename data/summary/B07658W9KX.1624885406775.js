They say it's all that's left. </p> <p>The Tower's survival is humanity's survival, and each must serve it faithfully.... </p> <p>Twenty-year-old Liana Castell must be careful what she thinks. Her life is defined by the number on her wristband - a rating out of 10 awarded based on her usefulness and loyalty to the Tower, and monitored by a device in her skull. A device that reports forbidden thoughts. </p> <p>Liana is currently a four, the lowest possible acceptable score, and despite her parents' perfect scores of 10, she struggles to increase it. Rebellious ideas come all too easily, and resentfulness seems part of her being. She is an overseer-in-training, but her future will be dark if she cannot raise her worth.... </p> <p>Threes require drug treatment. </p> <p>Twos are isolated. </p> <p>Ones disappear. </p> <p>When Liana's worst nightmare comes to pass and she drops to a three, desperation spurs her down a path few dare to tread.
