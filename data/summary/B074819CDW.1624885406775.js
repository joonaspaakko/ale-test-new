window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I knew the sins of my past would call to collect what was left of my soul. If I'd known the price I'd pay, I would've sacrificed more to stay hidden from the magic. </p> <p>In the middle of Wyoming - away from the abnormals of the world - I thought I was free and clear. I started a new life. Found a love I'd never known in a husband, and a son who was my everything. </p> <p>And in a blinding instant, that life was stolen from me. </p> <p>The rage of a grieving mother is an ugly beast. More so when she has the skills and killer instinct to back up the wrath and the knowledge that an accident was anything but. </p> <p>Once more, I will pick up my guns. This time to hunt those who took my husband's and son's lives. </p> <p>Let them see the assassin, trained to kill abnormals and stalk the shadows again. </p> <p>Let them see the Phoenix rise from the fragments of a broken life as she burns with a fury that cannot be contained. </p> <p>Let the killing games begin. </p>";
