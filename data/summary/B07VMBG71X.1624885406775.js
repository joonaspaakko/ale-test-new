Thompson and George R. R. Martin, with a little too much sci-fi in his head and acid in his blood stream. Like all good cult leaders, Doug is elusive and mysterious, and Katie quickly begins to wonder if this cult is truly just a gnarly collection of weirdos hanging out in the woods, or is there something else going on here?</p> <p>The Zeta Family was created and written by Gretchen Enders and Produced by Kelly&amp;Kelly.</p> <p>Director - Chris Kelly</p> <p>Producer - Michael Tanko Grand</p> <p>Executive Producer - Will Rogers, Jim Colgan, and Pat Kelly</p> <p>Production support by Jayme Catsouphes and Renée Vargas</p> <p>Audio Editing and Sound Design team - Chris Kelly, Greg Ng, Jay MacMillan, and Paul Tedeschini</p> <p>Recorded at Kelly&amp;Kelly Studios and on location in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>This product features dynamic multi-cast performances, musical scoring, and immersive sound design.</p> <p><b>Note: </b><b><i>The Zeta Family</i></b><b> contains explicit content.&nbsp;</b></p>";
