At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable noises and self-closing doors, but Hill House is gathering its powers and will soon choose one of them to make its own. </p>Shirley Jackson (1916–1965), a celebrated writer of horror, wrote such classic novels as <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i> and <i>The Bird’s Nest</i>, as well as one of the most famous short stories in the English language, “The Lottery”. She has influenced such writers as Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, and Richard Matheson. <p></p>";
