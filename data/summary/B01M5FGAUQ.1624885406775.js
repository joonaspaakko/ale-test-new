But New York City isn't what it used to be, and I don't mean the recent crash. </p> <p>Amateur casters are calling up creatures they shouldn't be able to. And there's been a murder at the city's most hallowed cathedral, a message in blood on the victim's back the NYPD wants me to interpret, like yesterday. </p> <p>Something tells me I'm in over my head. And that's not just Chinatown's newest mob boss, a scary-powerful vampire, or my possessed cat talking. </p> <p>No matter how much magic I hurl, worse keeps chasing bad, and I'm amassing enemies like they're aluminum cans. </p> <p>Did I mention the end of the world might be nigh? </p> <p>Damn. Maybe I'm the amateur here. </p>";
