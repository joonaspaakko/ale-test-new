Recently, a similar party had also attempted to explore the town and was never heard from again. Now the area is believed to be haunted. This crew is about to discover, 20 miles from civilization with a blizzard bearing down, that they are not alone, and the past is very much alive. </p> <p>Revised edition: This edition of <i>Abandon</i> includes editorial revisions. </p>";
