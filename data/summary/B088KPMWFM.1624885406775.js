window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the year 2047, Lochlan takes the bus to his soul-sucking job answering phones to remain unnoticed. Life is easier that way. Little attachment. Few friends. That means less people caught in the crossfire when he loses control again.&nbsp;</p> <p>The last time he came close to losing it was when he was around Zemila. That was five years ago, just before he disappeared. That was why he disappeared. He’s good at that. Disappearing. Resettling. Being overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>That is, until the visions started. Prophetic visions.&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s when he knew the Old World had found him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>These weren’t the fun kind of visions…if there were such a thing. They were the watch-people-die kind, the try-to-stop-it-before-it-happened kind, the maybe-save-some-lives kind. He thought the visions were his redemption. A redemption he didn’t believe he deserved. When one of them led him to Zemila, he thought it meant he wasn’t a danger to her anymore. That he wasn’t a danger to anyone anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Power attracts enemies. Lochlan thought he’d learned this lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>He was wrong. Wrong about the visions. Wrong about everything. And it was going to cost him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Him and everyone he loved.</p>";
