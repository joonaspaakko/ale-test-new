Except the world he’s being sent to isn’t the same one he came from. It’s not even a similar period in time, but from something long past in history.</p> <p>The dark ages.</p> <p>And part of the deal to live again, is to make pacts with others. Pacts that would bind the soul of those who take a deal to the same entity who owns Alex’s soul.</p> <p>How much would you give of yourself to live on is an easy question.</p> <p>The better question, is how much would you take from others?</p> <p>If Alex wants to keep living, to keep his soul from being sent to the darkest corner of hell, he’ll have to ask himself that question.</p> <p>Daily.</p> <p>Warning: This novel explores dark subjects, and what people will give up of themselves, and each other, to get what they want. The main character is written as a real person in a tough situation, and will not make choices that line up with societal and cultural norms.</p> <p>It contains adult themes and moral ambiguities.&nbsp;</p> <p>As with my previous work, explicit scenes are found within. It has violence and a harem relationship.</p>";
