But of all people...why him? </p> <p>Is it because he was a violent Chicago gangster and this is his chance at redemption? </p> <p>Is it because he is a modern-day Job whose suffering is beyond human comprehension? </p> <p>Over the next century - or two - he will try to find out. With a sly, aristocratic voice and a healthy appetite for women and anarchy, Zebulon Finch spins a tale of his travels across a young America, watching the country grow and mature, knowing that his mind and body will never do the same. </p> <p>Yes, he is witty. He is also vain. Absolutely brilliant, too. And he is always entertaining. But have no doubt - Zebulon Finch has a heart as vulnerable as anyone's. Too bad he doesn't learn to use it till after it has stopped beating.... </p>";
