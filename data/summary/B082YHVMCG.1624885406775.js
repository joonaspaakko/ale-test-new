They have their reasons.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Samantha is a professional seductress and con artist with a heart of gold. If she talked about her work, she’d tell you she only pilfers organs for medical research and that she only takes one kidney, and she only steals those kidneys from dishonest people. It’s hell on her social life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Abe is the doctor and Sam's partner in crime. He isn’t much of a criminal. Except for the kidney stealing. But he’s using that money to fund his research that he anticipates will be able to cure diabetes. So, all for a good cause...? You decide. Of course, it's hell on his social life.</p> <p><i>Cut and Run</i> was performed by Meg Ryan, D’Arcy Carden, Sam Richardson, Rachel Bloom, Thomas Lennon, Ed Begley Jr, Eugene Cordero, Baron Vaughn, Carlos Alazraqui, Arturo del Puerto, Dustin Ybarra, Aaron Abrams, Ginger Gonzaga, Greg Santos, Oscar Montoya, Roberta Valderrama, and Shulie Cowen.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Dynamite Lady”, an original song, was written and performed by Aimee Mann and Ted Leo.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Cut and Run</i> was written and co-produced by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker</p> <p>Director - Alexandra Barreto&nbsp;</p> <p>Executive Producer - Morgan Jones&nbsp;</p> <p>Audio Editing and Sound Design team - Tyler Dorson, Marc Atkinson, Emma Burlingame, Matt Beagle, and Jake Young&nbsp;</p> <p>Recorded at Marc Graue Studios&nbsp;</p>";
