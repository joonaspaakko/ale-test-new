Not emotionally scarred top-secret ex-army cyborgs, and certainly not good cops with bad habits.</p> <p>Join New Boston's most famous fixer for his first week in the most dangerous part of town. All he wanted was a quiet place to hide, but now he has to team up with the last good cop in Dockside if they expect to stop a gang war and protect the hard-working folks just trying to make an honest living.</p> <p>It's good cop versus, bad cop, gang leader versus mobster, and Roland Tankowicz versus everybody in a high-stakes contest for control of Dockside. He may be brand new to the job, but the smart money is on everybody's favorite Army surplus cyborg as he doubles down on the deadliest game in Dockside:</p> <p><i>Escalante</i>.</p>";
