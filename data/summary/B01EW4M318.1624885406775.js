I'm the guy who knows how to save you from an evil curse or angry vampire. </p> <p>At least, I was that guy until the Society of Shadows sent me to Dearmont, Maine, a sleepy town that had a zero rating on the supernatural occurrences scale. </p> <p>My plan was to spend my days sitting in the office with nothing to do except drink coffee and eat apple bakes made by Felicity, my new assistant. </p> <p>But when a woman hires me to find out if her son has been possessed by a demon at a rich kids' party, and a young man comes to the office insisting he's been bitten by a werewolf, Dearmont goes from zero to hero. </p> <p>Oh, and did I mention that someone in the Society wants me dead? </p> <p>Time to sharpen the swords and go to work. </p>";
