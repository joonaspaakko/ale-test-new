Never mind his history of wanting me dead. Or undead. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the mayor wants me on his team - an offer that's only slightly less unnerving given our recent clash. So who's really behind the purge? City Hall? The werewolves? Or is it the brainchild of the fae, whose newest advisor to the mayor slipped from my bed and life four months ago? </p> <p>I'm getting the cold feeling someone's trying to manipulate the program, and me, to set off a larger war, one that could explode through the city. </p> <p>One thing's for sure. If I don't get my head straight and my magic on, it's going to be a hell of a summer. </p>";
