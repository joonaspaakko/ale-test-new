In New York, a homeless person is run over by a bus and lives. In Tokyo, a teenager jumps off a high rise building and fails in taking her own life. All over the world, miracles like these transpire, and people breathe a sigh of relief.</p> <p>But for the next week, some people will begin to suspect a terrible truth. A handful will even search for it. One man will find it.</p> <p>And in seven days, all hell will break loose.</p> <p><i>Note: Graphic violence and language.</i></p>";
