In the aftermath, his widow, Jane Hawk, does what all her grief, fear, and fury demand: find the truth, no matter what.&nbsp;</p> <p>People of talent and accomplishment, people admired and happy and sound of mind, have been committing suicide in surprising numbers. When Jane seeks to learn why, she becomes the most-wanted fugitive in America. Her powerful enemies are protecting a secret so important - so terrifying - that they will exterminate anyone in their way.</p> <p>But all their power and viciousness may not be enough to stop a woman as clever as they are cold-blooded, as relentless as they are ruthless - and who is driven by a righteous rage they can never comprehend. Because it is born of love.</p>";
