window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everson Croft here, professor of mythology and nervous as sin. Tonight's the night I tell Caroline the truth: about my feelings, my magic, everything. </p> <p>So why am I surprised when Detective Vega calls me to a new case? An elusive creature is chewing up residents in a housing project run by rival gangs. One more mangled body and the place will explode into warfare. </p> <p>Problem is, someone's protecting the killer. All signs point to the vampire Arnaud - who's just upped the stakes. If I don't send Detective Vega down a trail of bad leads, he'll snatch her child. But is Arnaud trying to derail the investigation or twist it to his own ends, ones that could reshape the city? </p> <p>Worse, Caroline has disappeared, and I'm under suspicion. No one believes I last saw her with Angelus, a mysterious hunk and full-blooded faerie. Dangerous no matter how you slice it. </p> <p>Two cases: one personal, one professional, and both going to hell in a hurry. </p> <p>Time to wizard up. </p>";
