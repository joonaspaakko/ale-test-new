K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer, Anne Rice - only a few writers capture the imagination the way that Deborah Harkness has with her <i>New York Times</i> best-selling All Souls trilogy. <i>A Discovery of Witches </i>introduces reluctant witch Diana Bishop, vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and the battle for a lost, enchanted manuscript known as Ashmole 782.&nbsp;</p> <p>Picking up from <i>A Discovery of Witches</i>’ cliffhanger ending, <i>Shadow of Night </i>takes Diana and Matthew on a trip through time to Elizabethan London, where they are plunged into a world of spies, magic, and a coterie of Matthew’s old friends, the School of Night. As the search for Ashmole 782 deepens and Diana seeks out a witch to tutor her in magic, the net of Matthew’s past tightens around them, and they embark on a very different - and vastly more dangerous - journey. &nbsp;</p>";
