window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“There is nobody who does [military SF] better than Marko Kloos. His Frontlines series is a worthy successor to such classics as </b><b><i>Starship Troopers</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Forever War</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>We All Died at Breakaway Station.</i></b><b>” - George R. R. Martin</b></p> <p>The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements: You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world...or you can join the service.</p> <p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price...and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.</p> <p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is an addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: This edition of </b><b><i>Terms of Enlistment </i></b><b>includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";
