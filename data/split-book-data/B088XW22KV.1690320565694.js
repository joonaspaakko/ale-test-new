The raid yields a prize - the airship’s captain who is, to Shae’s shock, a man.</p> <p>Together with a reluctant heroine named Bela, they learn the truth of their shared history: the Windborn and Seaborn come from the same people, split apart by blood magick when a race of immortal mechanical men betrayed their human makers.</p> <p>Now, these unlikely allies must make a desperate journey to confront the secrets of the past - and stop the dark magick at its source.</p> <p>Michael Livingston is also the author of<i> Black Crow, White Snow</i>; <i>The Shards of Heaven</i>; and <i>At the End of Babel</i>.</p>";
