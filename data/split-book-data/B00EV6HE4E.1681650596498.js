But when things start getting weird in the Electric Apple, Private Unaffiliated Paranormal Investigations is stretched to the limits, trying to keep one step ahead and out of trouble. Add in rumors of a powerful creature gunning for us and it's not just our rep on the line this time - if we don't solve this case, everyone will suffer. </p><p>Fortunately, around here, when the going gets weird, the weird hire us.…</p>";
