Lynch has a great sense of dialogue and pitch overall, and keeps this dramatic tale moving.\" -</b><b><i>Locus</i></b></p> <p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Jay Kristoff comes </b><b><i>Empire of the Vampire</i></b><b>, the first volume of an astonishing new dark fantasy saga.</b></p> <p><i>From holy cup comes holy light;</i><br> <i>The faithful hand sets world aright.</i><br> <i>And in the Seven Martyrs’ sight,</i><br> <i>Mere man shall end this endless night.</i></p> <p>It has been twenty-seven long years since the last sunrise. For nearly three decades, vampires have waged war against humanity; building their eternal empire even as they tear down our own. Now, only a few tiny sparks of light endure in a sea of darkness.</p> <p>Gabriel de León is a silversaint: a member of a holy brotherhood dedicated to defending realm and church from the creatures of the night. But even the Silver Order could not stem the tide once daylight failed us, and now, only Gabriel remains.</p> <p>Imprisoned by the very monsters he vowed to destroy, the last silversaint is forced to tell his story.
