window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nothing is trickier than the truth. All Loki the trickster god of Asgard wants is a peaceful life where he's free to stir up a bit of harmless mischief. But when he's struck by a painful vision of blood, ash, and death he knows his fun has run out. Refusing to have his life obliterated by some stuffy prophecy, Loki feels he must save Asgard. Except the gods stand in his way. They don't trust the God of Lies, which means his only hope is to return to Odin, the man he wished to forget thanks to their complicated history.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Loki meets a mortal woman, his plans hit a snag. Sigyn is delightfully stubborn and quick with a blade. She also, inexplicably, possesses a divine element found only in a god. As Loki falls deeply in love with her, he never expects their bond to fulfill the prophecy threatening all their lives.</p> <p>Forced between honoring his oath with Odin or protecting the woman he loves, Loki will discover that the only thing crueler than truth are the lies behind it all. And the truth changes everything.</p>";
