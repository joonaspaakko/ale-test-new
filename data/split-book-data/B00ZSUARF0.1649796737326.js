window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Mountain Man</i>, book 1: Boomstick. Samurai bat. Motorcycle leather. And the will to live among the unliving. Augustus Berry lives a day-to-day existence comprised of waking up, getting drunk, and preparing for the inevitable day when \"they\" will come up the side of his mountain and penetrate his fortress. Living on the outskirts of a city and scavenging for whatever supplies remain after civilization died two years ago, Gus knows that every time he goes down into undead suburbia could be his last. </p> <p>Not only does he face a corpse-infested urban hell, human scavengers, and unending loneliness, but now a new mystery has risen.... The undead are disappearing from the streets. A force is gathering beyond the mountain man's wildest nightmares, even more relentless and terrifying than the roaming tides of dead flesh. And it's preparing to hunt. Contains graphic language and scenes of violence. </p> <p><i>Safari</i>, book 2: A new mystery has risen for Gus - the undead are disappearing from the streets. A force is gathering beyond the mountain man's darkest nightmares, even more relentless and terrifying than the roaming tides of dead flesh. And it's preparing to hunt. </p> <p><i>Hellifax</i>, book 3: A serial killer stalks the ice-glazed streets. Half-frozen deadheads choke the avenues.
