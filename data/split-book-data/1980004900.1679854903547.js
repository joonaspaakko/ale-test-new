window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Emperor needs necromancers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead nonsense.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tamsyn Muir’s <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap out of the audio, as skillfully animated as arcane revenants. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won’t set her free without a service.&nbsp;</p> <p>Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon’s sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, some things are better left dead.</p>";
