Bray (<i>The Martian</i>): </p> <p>Special Agent Roarke thought he knew what evil was. </p> <p>He was wrong. </p> <p>FBI Special Agent Matthew Roarke is closing in on a bust of a major criminal organization in San Francisco when he witnesses an undercover member of his team killed right in front of him on a busy street, an accident Roarke can't believe is coincidental. His suspicions put him on the trail of a mysterious young woman who appears to have been present at each scene of a years-long string of accidents and murders, and who may well be that most rare of killers: a female serial. </p> <p>Roarke's hunt for her takes him across three states...while in a small coastal town, a young father and his five-year-old son, both wounded from a recent divorce, encounter a lost and compelling young woman on the beach and strike up an unlikely friendship without realizing how deadly she may be. </p> <p>As Roarke uncovers the shocking truth of her background, he realizes she is on a mission of her own, and he must race to capture her before more blood is shed. </p> <p>\"This interstate manhunt has plenty of thrills.... Sokoloff keeps the drama taut and the pages flying.\" </p> <p>- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> </p>";
