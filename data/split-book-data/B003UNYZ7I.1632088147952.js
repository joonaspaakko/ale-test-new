window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get ready for white-knuckled listening. Greaney's debut novel - and future feature film - introduces the enigmatic and elusive Court Gentry, a former CIA operative and a legendary hired gun. With a terrifying ability to vaporize targets and a strict moral code, he stalks the gray margins of the world, moving silently from job to job, accomplishing the impossible, then fading away.

In a constant state of escape and pursuit, Gentry tears through the Middle East and Europe in a riveting life-or-death race against time. </p> <p>Fast-paced, well-researched, and fun, <i>The Gray Man</i> is already being adapted for a movie by the company behind Tom Cruise's <i>Knight &amp; Day</i>.</p>";
