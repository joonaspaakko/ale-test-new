window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Strength. Honor. Death.</p> <p>Once every year, in the city of Sunja, gladiators meet within the arena known as Sunja's Pit. Some men enter for the lure of fortune, some for the fame, and some simply for the fight. The games continue for days until a champion is finally crowned. Or until all involved perish.</p> <p>Four companions struggle to change their lives in and out of the arena as it becomes clear that to be a Free Trained pit fighter is to live with a mark on one's head. And not everyone is pleased to learn of their plans, as the four warriors soon discover that the path to establishing a formal presence in the games, after the season has started, is infinitely more difficult than expected. All the while, unseen forces watch, waiting for the best time to strike at the companions and take everything that they have.</p> <p>This is blood sport at its finest.</p> <p>At its worst.</p> <p>At its longest.</p>";
