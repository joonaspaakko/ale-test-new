window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's not easy, being king. You can't always rule a kingdom and still do what needs to be done. </p> <p>Eric - or King Halar, also known as the Demon King - has more than enough problems without the crown. But quitting the job of king isn't easy, either - unless you want to be beheaded. Most people regard that as an unsatisfactory way to quit. Even vampire lords tend to be cautious about guillotines. A king who loses his head has a real problem...or none at all. </p> <p>It's time to sort some of these problems out, settle a few more, and kill the rest. But at what cost? </p> <p><i>Knightfall</i> is the fourth book of the Nightlord series. It picks up exactly where <i>Orb</i> (book three) ends, and carries on with an adventure of epic proportions! </p>";
