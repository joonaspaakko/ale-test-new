window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Callie Penrose - and I'm a rookie spell-slinger from Kansas City. I work part-time for the Vatican Shepherds, hunting monsters for them, but you won't find me in the pews on Sundays. Not really my thing.</p> <p>But when my boss is injured by a werewolf, it's time for me to put my big girl pants on. Because the Spear of Longinus - the one that allegedly stabbed Jesus on the Cross - has surfaced, and it's going up for auction. And every flavor of monster in my city wants it. Even a demon and a Nephilim, just for fun.</p> <p>The only way to survive the war and get the spear first is to team up with Nate Temple, a handsome, reckless wizard from St. Louis. But he has a dark side, too, and I don't fully trust him, despite what my body tells me.</p> <p>Framed for murders I didn't commit, I find I've become Kansas City's most hated wizard overnight. Because keeping the spear will get me killed, but giving it away will get everyone else killed. And letting Nate handle it will only paint me as weak. What's a girl to do?</p> <p>Especially when Hell knows more about my past than I do...</p>";
