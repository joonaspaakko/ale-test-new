window.bookSummaryJSON = "Conrad Nomikos has a long, rich personal history that he'd rather not talk about. And, as arts commissioner, he's been given a job he'd rather not do. Escorting an alien grandee on a guided tour of the shattered remains of Earth is not something he relishes - especially since it is apparent that this places him at the center of high-level intrigue that has some bearing on the future of Earth itself. But Conrad is a <i>very</i> special guy.... <p> Written by the late Roger Zelazny, <i>This Immortal</i> was originally published under the title <i>...and Call Me Conrad</i>. It shared the 1966 Hugo Award for Best Novel with Frank Herbert's Dune.</p>";
