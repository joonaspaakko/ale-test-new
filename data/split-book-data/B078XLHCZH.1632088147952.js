window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>300,000 Copies Sold Worldwide</b></p> <p>The Echoes of Fate, a Prophecy Uttered Unto the World a Thousand Years Ago, Cannot Be Denied....</p> <p>Mankind has lorded over the land of Illian for a thousand years, building on the ruins left by the elves, as if it were their birthright. A thousand years is a long time for an immortal race to see the truth of things, a truth that has remained unsaid for a millennium - elves are superior. They are faster, stronger, and connected to the magical realm in a way that man could never grasp. Illian should belong to them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unaware of the shadow that looms in the east, the six kingdoms of man are fractured, unallied, and clawing at each other's gates for more power.</p> <p>This isn't just war set to ravage the land, but a slaughter - the world of man cannot hope to survive.</p> <p>Thrown into the heart of this war is a man known by many names; an Outlander of the wilds, an assassin, a ranger. Asher was born a thousand years ago, to a life he doesn't remember. Forty years of brutal training and killing for money has beaten the earliest years of his life away, leaving his ties to the oldest of evils a mystery to all....</p> <p><b><i>Rise of The Ranger</i></b><b> Launches an Unmissable Epic Fantasy Series.</b></p>";
