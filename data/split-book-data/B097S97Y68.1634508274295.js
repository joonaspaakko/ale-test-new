At night laying in the coffin-like bed, it is normal for her to hear the creaking floorboards, to see sinister spirits hiding in the shadows, vengeful phantoms, and demons.</p> <p>As a young adult Mary once again finds herself down on her luck and is forced to reenter this most dreaded of places, but this time she is accompanied by her two children. The master of the workhouse believing her to be a bad influence and fearing she would stoke instability among the other inmates quickly throws her back out onto the desolate and dangerous Victorian streets without her babies.</p> <p>During a chance encounter, she meets Charles, owner of the Royal and manager of Drury Lane theater. She embarks on a new career \"treading the boards\" and is embroiled in the underbelly of Victorian life where debauchery and decadence run rife. Throughout her trials and many performances, she seeks to reunite with her lost boys. The stage is set for vengeful spirits and for a macabre chill to blow through theater-land.</p>";
