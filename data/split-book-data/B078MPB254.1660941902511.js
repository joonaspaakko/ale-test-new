window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Book 4: Paint It Black</b></p> <p>In the fourth installment of The Black Knight Chronicles, Jimmy Black is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day and a darned fine pity party, serving the finest alcohol, when a call from his not-quite-girlfriend-cop forces him to sober up and stare at jawbones. \"Cold case\" takes on a whole new meaning when vampire detectives risk life and limbs (literally) to connect a series of decades-old kidnappings in Charlotte with current missing persons cases. All clues lead through the veil of Faerieland to the legendary Goblin's Market, a magical bazaar where anything is available--for a price. The boys can barely stay out of trouble in Charlotte. As fresh meat at The Market, they'll be lucky to survive the day.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Book 5: In the Still of the Knight</b></p> <p>The bodies are piling up!Murders are happening outside Charlotte's hottest nightspots. A new vampire society has set up shop in the sewers. And Jimmy Black's about to run afoul of the Master of the City. If Jimmy weren't already a vampire, the week ahead would be the death of him. Between murder, monsters, pesky vampire ethics, and territorial disputes, Jimmy is about to discover how far he's willing to go to save the world and one friend's soul. There are no easy choices, even for vampire geeks.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Book 6: Man in Black</b></p> <p>The latest book in the award-winning <i>Black Knight Chronicles</i> is a raucous ride through the city of Charlotte's seedy underbelly with the most unlikely crime lord ever. Jimmy Black's knack for stumbling into the right place at the wrong time has landed him his dream job--or worst nightmare--Master Vampire of the City. Almost everyone that works for him wants him dead. His best friend isn't speaking to him.&nbsp;</p>";
