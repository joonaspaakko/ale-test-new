window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What happens when all the myths, legends, and things that go bump in the night come out to the world as real? Well, the world does as it always does: It rejected them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Welcome to Avalantis, Alaska, the world’s first supercity with over 50 million myth and mundane citizens and home of those rejected by society. Although due to pesky things like murder end explosions, there are a few fewer citizens. When the former Greek god Hermes dies, three unusual cops from the Avalantis PD are recruited into a secret organization known as Mortal, who has apparently been watching the Myths for longer than mankind realizes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their mission is to find and apprehend the mysterious figure known as “The Laughing Man”, the one responsible for a recent string of deaths. These three new recruits will have to use all their skill, strength, and wits to find and defeat the “The Laughing Man”. That is, if they don’t kill each other first.&nbsp;</p> <p>Agents of Mortal: <i>Deicide</i> is an action-comedy that is packed with excitement, laughs, and more than a few touching moments.</p>";
