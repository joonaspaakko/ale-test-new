window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Over a million copies of the Iron Druid books sold</b></p> <p>Kevin Hearne creates the ultimate Atticus O'Sullivan adventure in the grand finale of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Iron Druid Chronicles.</p> <p>Unchained from fate, the Norse gods Loki and Hel are ready to unleash Ragnarok, aka the Apocalypse, upon the earth. With a whole host of dark allies on their side, there's a globe-spanning battle on the cards - one which Druid Atticus O'Sullivan will be hard-pressed to survive, much less win.</p> <p>Atticus must recruit the aid of an Indian witch and a trickster god in hopes that they'll give him just enough leverage to both save Gaia and see another sunrise. After all, if the world ends, who's going to make sure the hound Oberon gets his well-deserved snack?</p>";
