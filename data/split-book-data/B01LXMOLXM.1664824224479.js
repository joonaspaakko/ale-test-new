window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The jaws of winter are clamping down on the city of Halifax. As the light recedes, new terrors arise. </p> <p>Months after the war with Borland and his vicious were-brood, Kirk and Morris are experiencing curious after-effects. They're stronger, faster, and no longer vulnerable to the sharp sting of silver. There is one concern, however. They're forever hungry, and nothing they eat provides the same nourishment as what they consumed on the island of Newfoundland. And when a mysterious stranger rides into Moses Morris's territory wishing to hunt, the were-warden knows the visitor isn't after deer. </p> <p>The ultimate race begins as Kirk and Morris lead a host of wardens to put down one of their own, before the next full moon, when an entire city will be subjected to a voracious appetite. </p>";
