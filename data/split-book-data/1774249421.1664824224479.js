window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Award-winning performers Wil Wheaton (</b><b><i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Ready Player One</i></b><b> audiobook) and Katherine McNamara (</b><b><i>Shadowhunters</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Stand</i></b><b>, CW’s </b><b><i>Arrow</i></b><b>) bring this mind-bending, deeply imagined sci-fi tale to life.</b></p> <p>The real world is only where you breathe....</p> <p>In High Earth, digital entertainment is everything. Shows. Virtual worlds. Simulations - there’s something for everybody in a city where working for a living has been rendered obsolete by technological advancements. Even a short walk outside to visit with others is no longer necessary. Just load into the network and you can be with anyone, anywhere.</p> <p>For Asher Reinhart, nothing compares to <i>Ignis</i>; a live reality show that pushes human beings to their very extremes. As a volunteer director, Asher closely monitors the lives of those living on an interstellar ark, believing they're the last of humanity.</p> <p>But when it's determined that the life of the show’s brightest star, Mission, must be put in danger to boost declining ratings, Asher is forced to choose: the show he loves or the woman whose existence has been the focus of his attention since the day he was born.</p> <p>From number-one Audible best-selling author and Nebula Award nominee Rhett C. Bruno comes a story about the power of human connection. <i>The Truman Show</i> meets <i>Ready Player One</i> in a novel perfect for fans of Hugh Howey, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Michael Crichton.</p>";
