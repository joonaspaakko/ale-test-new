window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can a genetically engineered psychopath grow a conscience, get the girl, and save the galaxy? Two out of three ain't bad. </p><p>Rico has a problem. The experimental program that gave him the high intelligence and lightning reflexes he needs as a hit man for a galactic crime syndicate left him incapable of internalizing moral imperatives the rest of us take for granted. It takes real effort for him to pass as a normal human being and he avoids it whenever he can. But he has a job he loves, a fast ship, and plenty of cash. So life is good. </p><p>When Rico takes an assignment on a planet where a major political conference seeks to bring more order to the galaxy, he accidentally thwarts a terrorist attack and has to pose as a visiting cop from a faraway world. To complicate matters, he partners with a local female cop and soon realizes he has fallen in love. That shouldn't happen! But not everything is as it seems, and as the story speeds along from one unexpected plot twist to another, Rico discovers the secret of his own identity and faces a terrible choice. </p><p>Will Rico live to become fully human? Or will he die just as he grasps what has been missing from his life? </p><p>Frank Fleming's exciting debut novel combines action, romance, and moral philosophy in an entertainingly combustible mix.</p>";
