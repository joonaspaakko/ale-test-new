It’s ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ with XX chromosomes.” (<i>The Skimm</i>)</p> <p>“Deliciously duplicitous. . . . equally as twisty, spellbinding, and addictive as Gillian Flynn’s&nbsp;Gone Girl&nbsp;or Paula Hawkins’s&nbsp;The Girl on the Train.” (<i>Library Journal</i>,&nbsp;starred review)&nbsp;</p> <p>Amber Patterson is fed up. She's tired of being a nobody: a plain, invisible woman who blends into the background. She deserves more - a life of money and power like the one blond-haired, blue-eyed goddess Daphne Parrish takes for granted.&nbsp;</p> <p>To everyone in the exclusive town of Bishops Harbor, Connecticut, Daphne - a socialite and philanthropist - and her real-estate mogul husband, Jackson, are a couple straight out of a fairy tale.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amber's envy could eat her alive...if she didn't have a plan. Amber uses Daphne's compassion and caring to insinuate herself into the family's life - the first step in a meticulous scheme to undermine her. Before long Amber is Daphne's closest confidante, traveling to Europe with the Parrishes and their lovely young daughters and growing closer to Jackson. But a skeleton from her past may undermine everything that Amber has worked toward, and if it is discovered, her well-laid plan may fall to pieces.&nbsp;</p> <p>With shocking turns and dark secrets that will keep you guessing until the very end, <i>The Last Mrs. Parrish</i> is a fresh, juicy, and utterly addictive thriller from a diabolically imaginative talent.&nbsp;</p>";
