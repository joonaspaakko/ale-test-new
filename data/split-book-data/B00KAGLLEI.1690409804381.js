Odds against you? Call the Equalizer.”</i><br> <br> Robert McCall is a former covert operations officer for the CIA who tries to atone for past sins by offering, free of charge, his services as a protector, an investigator, and a troubleshooter—often literally.

The club is actually a front for an elite assassination service—run by an old enemy of McCall’s. To save his client’s life, the Equalizer is going to have to confront the sins of his past…</p>";
