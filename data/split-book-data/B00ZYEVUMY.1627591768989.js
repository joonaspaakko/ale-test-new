Half-demon racket boss Nicky Agnelli is fighting to hang on to his empire, leaving a trail of dead informants in his wake, while Daniel's ex-girlfriend, Jennifer, rallies her forces on the street and aims her sights at Nicky's crown. </p> <p>Meanwhile, homeless people are vanishing by the dozens. Daniel has bigger problems to worry about, but a plea from an old friend sends him on a search for answers. What he finds is a conspiracy 20 years in the making, involving a power-hungry senator, occult experiments, murderous British mercenaries...and Lauren Carmichael, Daniel's nemesis. </p> <p>From a gunfight in the Arizona badlands to unearthing buried secrets in a New York laboratory, the hunt is on.

He's got black magic, bullets, and the art of the con. It's high noon in Vegas, and when the dust settles, only one side will be left standing. </p> <p>May the best villain win. </p>";
