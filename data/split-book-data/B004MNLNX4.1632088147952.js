window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audiobook one of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling All Souls Trilogy - \"a wonderfully imaginative grown-up fantasy with all the magic of Harry Potter and Twilight” (<i>People</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Now “[a] hot show that’s like Twilight meets <i>Outlander</i>” (<i>Thrillist</i>) streaming on Sundance Now and Shudder and coming to television this April on AMC and BBC America.&nbsp;</p> <p>Deborah Harkness’ sparkling debut, <i>A Discovery of Witches</i>, has brought her into the spotlight and galvanized fans around the world. In this tale of passion and obsession, Diana Bishop, a young scholar and a descendant of witches, discovers a long-lost and enchanted alchemical manuscript, Ashmole 782, deep in Oxford's Bodleian Library. Its reappearance summons a fantastical underworld, which she navigates with her leading man, vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont.&nbsp;</p> <p>Harkness has created a universe to rival those of Anne Rice, Diana Gabaldon, and Elizabeth Kostova, and she adds a scholar's depth to this riveting tale of magic and suspense. The story continues in audiobook two, <i>Shadow of Night</i>, and concludes with <i>The Book of Life</i>.</p>";
