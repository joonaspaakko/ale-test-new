When the family is discovered, their peaceful existence is shattered and their lives changed forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Henry’s siblings are kidnapped, leaving him alone in the ruins of their home. Broken, altered, and tormented by all that has befallen him, he is driven to wreak vengeance upon those who assume him dead...by any means necessary.</p> <p>Fans of Cormac McCarthy’s <i>The Road</i> or Emily St. John Mandel’s <i>Station Eleven</i> will enjoy the raw, emotional pull of debut author Peter Hackshaw’s writing.</p>";
