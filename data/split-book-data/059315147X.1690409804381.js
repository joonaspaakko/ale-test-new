One of them is infected with an alien parasite.</i></b></p> <p><b>In this dark science fiction thriller, a young woman must confront her past so the human race will have a future.</b></p> <p>Rosalyn Devar is on the run from her famous family, the bioengineering job she's come to hate, and her messed-up life. She's run all the way to outer space, where she's taken a position as a \"space janitor\", cleaning up ill-fated research expeditions. But no matter how far she goes, Rosalyn can't escape herself. After too many mistakes on the job, she's given one last chance: take care of salvaging the <i>Brigantine</i>, a research vessel that has gone dark, with all crew aboard thought dead.</p> <p>But the <i>Brigantine</i>'s crew are very much alive - if not entirely human. Now, Rosalyn is trapped on board, alone with a crew infected by a mysterious parasitic alien. The captain, Edison Aries, seems to still maintain some control over himself and the crew, but he won't be able to keep fighting much longer. Rosalyn and Edison must find a way to stop the parasite's onslaught...or it may take over the entire human race.</p> <p>\"<i>Salvaged </i>scared the hell out of me, and I write horror for a living! Madeleine Roux conjures real darkness with a brilliant novel that any fan of ALIEN will simply devour. Brava!\" (Jonathan Maberry, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>V-Wars</i> and <i>Rage</i>)</p>";
