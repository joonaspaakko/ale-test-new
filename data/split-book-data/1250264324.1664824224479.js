To make the experiment work, they just need one last recruit: an ageing schoolteacher whose late mother was the foremost expert on the mathematics of paradox.</p> <p>2028: A young woman goes into surgery for routine brain surgery. In the days following her operation, she begins to hear another voice in her head...an unwanted presence which seems to have a will, and a purpose, all of its own - one that will disrupt her life entirely. The only choice left to her is a simple one.</p> <p>Does she resist...or become a collaborator?</p>";
