window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Men in Black</i> meets Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum in the new urban fantasy novel starring seer Makenna Fraser and her fellow agents at Supernatural Protection &amp; Investigation. </p> <p>The agents of Supernatural Protection &amp; Investigations (SPI) know that fighting evil is a full-time job, especially when a new designer drug - with mind-blowing side effects - hits the streets. It's called Brimstone. And after the first few hits, you'll see every supernatural beast sharing the sidewalk, train, or office with you. After that you'll start seeing the really scary stuff. </p> <p>I'm Makenna Fraser, seer for the SPI. And the collateral damage caused by Brimstone is something I'd like to unsee: dead drug dealers missing their hearts - and souls. Because your local pusher doesn't stand a chance against the new cartel muscling its way into New York. And since the drug can be produced only with magic and molten brimstone fresh from hell, that means a rift to the underworld is open somewhere in the city. And when - not if - the cartel loses control of it, well...it's going to be hell on Earth. </p>";
