But recently her behavior has been erratic and her drawings match, with stunning accuracy, the brittle pages of a Portuguese print dating back to 1642â€¦a drawing of an ancient lost city. A new expedition - along with Amy - is sent into the Congo, where they enter a secret world, and the only way out may be through a horrifying death..... </p> <p><i>Congo</i> was adapted to the screen and directed by Frank Marshall. </p>";
