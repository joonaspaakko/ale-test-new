window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Annie Collins is back!</b></p> <p>Becoming an overnight celebrity at age 16 should have been a lot more fun. Yes, there were times when it was extremely cool, but when the newness of it all wore off, Annie Collins was left with a permanent security detail and the kind of constant scrutiny that makes the college experience especially awkward.</p> <p>Not helping matters: she’s the only kid in school with her own pet spaceship.</p> <p>She would love it if things found some kind of normal, but as long as she has control of the most lethal - and only - interstellar vehicle in existence, that isn’t going to happen. Worse, things appear to be going in the other direction. Instead of everyone getting used to the idea of the ship, the complaints are getting louder. Public opinion is turning, and the demands that Annie turn over the ship are becoming more frequent. It doesn’t help that everyone seems to think Annie is giving them nightmares.</p> <p>Nightmares aren’t the only weird things going on lately. A government telescope in California has been abandoned, and nobody seems to know why.</p> <p>The man called on to investigate - Edgar Somerville - has become the go-to guy whenever there’s something odd going on, which has been pretty common lately. So far, nothing has panned out: no aliens or zombies or anything else that might be deemed legitimately peculiar...but now may be different, and not just because Ed can’t find an easy explanation. This isn’t the only telescope where people have gone missing, and the clues left behind lead back to Annie.</p> <p>It all adds up to a new threat that the world may just need saving from, requiring the help of all the Sorrow Falls survivors. The question is: are they saving the world with Annie Collins, or are they saving it from her?</p> <p><i>The Frequency of Aliens</i> is the exciting sequel to <i>The Spaceship Next Door</i>.</p>";
