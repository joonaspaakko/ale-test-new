Stones were tied to their ankles, and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town. </p> <p>Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them under. </p> <p>Like many locals, 17-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters' return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives, unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into. </p> <p>Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets.
