window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At Butler House, a series of grisly murders over a century have led many to believe it's haunted. To one scientist, it's the perfect place for an experiment in fear. Eight people, each chosen because they lived through a terrifying experience, are offered a million dollars to spend one night at Butler House. They can take whatever they want with them - religious items, survival gear, and weapons. All they need to do is last the night.</p> <p>But there is something evil in this house. Something very evil...and very real. And when the dying starts, it comes with horrifying violence and brutal finality. There are much scarier things than ghosts. Things that will kill you slowly and delight in your screams. Things that won't let you get out alive.</p>";
