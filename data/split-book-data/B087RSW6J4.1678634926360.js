A war is raging between gods and demons, with an unstoppable interdimensional terror - <b>THE BLEED</b> - destroying everything it touches. From ancient alien civilisations through to modern day London, through to deep space and beyond, nothing and no one is safe. The Bleed wants flesh. It wants to destroy life. It wants to be worshipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>London: next week.</i> <br> The Bleed strains at the edges of reality, and God has come to help Earth make a stand against the demons from beyond, but it's going to come down to one frightened kid to save the entire planet from a blood-soaked fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The moon: sometime in the future.</i> <br> A covert mission to colonize the moon is Earth's last chance.
