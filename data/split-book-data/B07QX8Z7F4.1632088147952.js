window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a remote town on the Suffolk coast, the local residents are stalked by a brutal killer.</p> <p>After the sighting of strange lights in the sky, the dismembered, burnt remains of the local RAF base commander are discovered in his car. An autopsy reveals that the victim showed signs of exposure to high radiation levels.</p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable Angela White enlists the aid of both John Handful and local reporter Yazmin Nash. The level of radiation the killer leaves in its wake should have killed any normal man by now, but the murders continue: the killer appears to be both more and less than human. And then when a leading government minister arrives the pressure is on for Handful to solve the case not only quickly but also quietly, by any means possible.</p> <p>Until a strange craft is discovered...</p> <p>Handful then turns from hunter to hunted, where everyone is playing for the highest stakes, and where violence becomes the only solution....</p>";
