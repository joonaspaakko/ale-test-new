window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner Listeners Choice Award - Best Science Fiction</b></p> <p>The Martian meets Gravity when Army Pilot Vaughn Singleton, Earth’s last man, rushes to Area 51 in search of a spaceplane after he discovers the last woman is stranded on the International Space Station and barely alive - thus beginning a race against time. The event that wiped life from the planet started at the supercollider. It created a rift in space-time. The astronaut stranded aboard the space station, Commander Angela Brown, is a theoretical physicist who used to work at the collider. She may be able to reverse the event, restoring the timeline and returning all life to the planet...if only she could get there. If you like action-packed audiobooks that leave you sitting in your car long after reaching your destination, you'll love the electrifying action in this trilogy of award-winning thrillers.</p> <p>Can Vaughn find a path to space and back? Can Angela - the only person capable of reversing humanity's disappearance - survive until he does?</p> <p><b>Find out now. Get </b><b><i>Solitude </i></b><b>today and start a series you won’t want to stop!</b></p> <p>\"Like The Martian on (and above) Earth. An epic survival story with very human characters, clever problem-solving and a gripping mystery. The end left me with no idea where Dean was going with the story, I couldn’t wait for the next book.” (Craig Alanson, <i>NYT </i>best-selling author of <i>Expeditionary Force</i>)</p> <p>\"R.C. Bray and Julia Whelan are individually stellar. Having them co-voice Dean M. Cole's superb Dimension Space Series is a stroke of genius. Rich with elements of every genre, <i>Solitude </i>is an outstanding listen.” (Nicholas Sansbury Smith, <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author of <i>Hell Divers</i>)</p>";
