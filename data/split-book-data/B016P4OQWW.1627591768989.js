window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A rich, dark fantasy of destiny, death, and the supernatural world hiding beneath the surface. </p> <p>Nettie Lonesome lives in a land of hard people and hard ground dusted with sand. She's a half breed who dresses like a boy, raised by folks who don't call her a slave but use her like one. She knows of nothing else. That is until the day a stranger attacks her. When nothing, not even a sickle to the eye, can stop him, Nettie stabs him through the heart with a chunk of wood, and he turns into black sand. </p> <p>And just like that, Nettie can <i>see</i>. </p> <p>But her newfound ability is a blessing and a curse. Even if she doesn't understand what's under her own skin, she can sense what everyone else is hiding - at least physically. The world is full of evil, and now she knows the source of all the sand in the desert. Haunted by the spirits, Nettie has no choice but to set out on a quest that might lead to her true kin...if the monsters along the way don't kill her first. </p>";
