window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Goodreads Choice Award finalist.</b></p> <p><b>“I enjoyed the hell out of </b><b><i>One Word Kill</i></b><b>. Mark is an excellent writer.” - George R.R. Martin</b></p> <p>In January 1986, fifteen-year-old boy-genius Nick Hayes discovers he’s dying. And it isn’t even the strangest thing to happen to him that week.</p> <p>Nick and his Dungeons &amp; Dragons-playing friends are used to living in their imaginations. But when a new girl, Mia, joins the group and reality becomes weirder than the fantasy world they visit in their weekly games, none of them are prepared for what comes next. A strange - yet curiously familiar - man is following Nick, with abilities that just shouldn’t exist. And this man bears a cryptic message: Mia’s in grave danger, though she doesn’t know it yet. She needs Nick’s help - now.</p> <p>He finds himself in a race against time to unravel an impossible mystery and save the girl. And all that stands in his way is a probably terminal disease, a knife-wielding maniac and the laws of physics.</p> <p>Challenge accepted.</p> <p><b><i>Ready Player One</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>Stranger Things</i></b><b> in this new novel by bestselling author Mark Lawrence.</b></p>";
