window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Perfect for fans of Madeleine Roux, Jonathan Maberry, and horror films like </b><b><i>28 Days Later </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Resident Evil</i></b><b>, this pulse-pounding, hair-raising, utterly terrifying novel is the first in a duology from the critically acclaimed author of the Taken trilogy.</b></p> <p>After receiving a distress call from a drill team on a distant planet, a skeleton crew is sent into deep space to perform a standard search-and-rescue mission.</p> <p>When they arrive, they find the planet littered with the remains of the project - including its membersâ€™ dead bodies. As they try to piece together what could have possibly decimated an entire project, they discover that some things are best left buried - and some monsters are only too ready to awaken.</p>";
