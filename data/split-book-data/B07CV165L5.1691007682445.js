It’s true!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Rivals! Frenemies Who Changed the World</i> is a riotous audio exclusive, like if <i>Monty Python</i> taught your history class. Each volume of four 30-minute histories will dig into the petty name-calling and grumbling grudges that led to many of the world’s greatest advancements, all delivered with a cheeky sense of humor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Choose sides: Cope or Marsh, the jerks who discovered so many dinosaurs; Hamilton or Burr, whose rivalry fueled American politics; Queen Elizabeth or Mary Queen of Scots, who fought to rule England; Adidas or Puma, whose rivalry changed the world of sports and fashion.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kidnappings, rock fights, duels, and explosions, <i>Rivals!</i> shows world leaders at their absolute best and their worst, often at the same time.&nbsp;</p>";
