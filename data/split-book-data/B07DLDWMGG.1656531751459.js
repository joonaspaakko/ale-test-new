window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A seemingly impossible mystery tests the keen mind and forensic skills of Joanna Blalock, the daughter of Sherlock Holmes and the heir to his unique talent for deduction, from </b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>best-selling author Leonard Goldberg.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The following case has not previously been disclosed to the public due to the sensitive information on foreign affairs. All those involved were previously bound by the Official Secrets Act. With the passage of time and the onset of the Great War, these impediments have been removed and the story can now be safely told.&nbsp;</p> <p>When an executed original of a secret treaty between England and France, known as the French Treaty, is stolen from the country estate of Lord Halifax, Scotland Yard asks Joanna, Dr. John Watson, Jr., and Dr. John Watson, Sr., to use their detective skills to participate in the hunt for the missing treaty. As the government becomes more restless to find the missing document and traditional investigative means fail to turn up the culprit, Joanna is forced to devise a clever plan to trap the thief and recover the missing treaty.&nbsp;</p> <p>Told from the point of view of Dr. John Watson, Jr., in a style similar to the original Sherlock Holmes stories, <i>A Study in Treason </i>is based partly on facts in our world and partly on the facts left to us by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>A Study in Treason</i></b><b> is the perfect audiobook for fans of Sherlock Holmes.</b></p>";
