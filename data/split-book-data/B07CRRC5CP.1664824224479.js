window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Bestseller</b></p> <p><i>Do you dare step through the red door?</i> Spencer Grant had no idea what drew him to the bar with the red door. He thought he would just sit down, have a slow beer or two, and talk to a stranger. He couldn’t know that it would lead to a narrow escape from a bungalow targeted by a SWAT team. Or that it would leave him a wanted man.</p> <p>But now Spencer is on the run from mysterious and ruthless men. He is in love with a woman he knows next to nothing about. And he is hiding from a past he can’t fully remember. On his trail is a shadowy security agency that answers to no one - including the U.S. government - and a man who considers himself a compassionate Angel of Death. But worst of all, Spencer Grant is on a collision course with inner demons he thought he’d buried years ago - inner demons that could destroy him if his enemies don’t first.</p>";
