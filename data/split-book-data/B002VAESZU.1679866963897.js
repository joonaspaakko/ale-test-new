window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A picturesque town. A woman on the run. An undercover agent. The first riveting novel in Catherine Coulter’s #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling FBI Thriller series.</b></p><p>Sally Brainerd can’t remember what happened the night her father was murdered. Maybe she did it. Or maybe it was her poor, traumatized mother. Either way, the safest place for her is far away from Washington, D.C. But while her aunt’s home in The Cove should be a quiet refuge, Sally can’t shake the feeling that there’s something not quite right about the postcard perfect little town.</p><p>Despite his target’s checkered past and convenient memory loss, FBI Special Agent James Quinlan isn’t convinced she’s the killer—but maybe she knows who is. As he uses his cover to get close to Sally and unearth the memories her mind has hidden away, James can’t deny his connection to the troubled woman. But as their lies and passions intertwine, Sally and James soon learn they aren’t the only ones keeping deadly secrets in The Cove….</p>";
