window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When the deal you need isn't the one you want...</b></p> <p>To protect Vega and her son from the demon-vampire Arnaud, I’ve secured spots for them in a powerful safe house. The price? Pledging my services to the Upholders - a group searching for stolen loved ones.</p> <p>My new teammates are a young minister, a snarky half-fae, a hulking mermaid, and a druid with major control issues. Bonded by said druid’s magic, I couldn’t wriggle out of this deal if I were coated in wizard’s oil.</p> <p>Now, we’re hunting demons in a past version of New York City that’s on the bad side of strange. But I can’t stop thinking about Arnaud. He’s too close to the ones I cherish and growing more lethal by the hour. He’s also gotten his talons on an enchanted item that could undo their protection.</p> <p>I need to fulfill my contract to the Upholders and race home. But dangers here are mounting, verging on biblical. If I don’t crank my magic to 11 and become the leader this team needs, I may never see Vega again...or hold our future child.</p> <p><i>Druid Bond</i> is the seventh novel in the Prof Croft urban fantasy series. If you like occult action, spell-crackling suspense, and moments of heart, heroism, and all-out laughter, you’ll love Prof Croft!</p>";
