window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Renegade Star, Book One</i></b></p> <p>Jace Hughes is a Renegade.</p> <p>That means taking almost any job that comes his way, no matter the situation. So long as he can keep his ship floating, he's free to live the life he wants. But that all changes when he meets Abigail Pryar, a nun looking for safe passage out of the system. Too bad there's something off about the cargo she's carrying.</p> <p>Jace knows he shouldn't ask too many questions, but when strange sounds start coming from inside the large, metal box, he can't help but check it out. Big mistake. To make matters worse, he's being pursued by unknown ships - people who want that cargo. Does Jace give up the goods and hand over the nun ...or does he risk it all for an even bigger payout?</p> <p><b><i>Renegade Atlas, book Two</i></b></p> <p>The search for Earth has begun.</p> <p>After barely escaping the Union's grasp, <i>The Renegade Star</i> is off to parts unknown. Every member of its crew is a wanted fugitive. None of them can ever return home.</p> <p>But all is not lost. Thanks to Lex, a strange girl with a remarkable gift, the path to Earth has been revealed. According to ancient myth, Earth holds valuable treasures, lost technology, and endless secrets, ripe for the taking. Jace and his new friends have a chance to discover it all, but only if they can keep Lex out of the Union's grasp.</p> <p>Doing so won't be easy. With enemies on all sides, the deck is stacked against them, but nothing in this universe comes easy when you're a Renegade.</p> <p>If you're a fan of <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, or <i>Leviathan Wakes</i>, you'll love this epic, space opera thriller.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains action, cussing, and general badassery. Listen at your own risk.</b></p>";
