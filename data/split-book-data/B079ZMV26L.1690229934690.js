window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Poe's classic tale lives on in this Gothic novel of ancestral madness in the mountains of modern-day North Carolina, from a <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author. </p> <p>Ever since Edgar Allan Poe looted a family's ignoble secret history for his classic story \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", living in the shadow of that sick dynasty has been an inescapable scourge for generations of Usher descendants. But not for horror novelist Rix Usher. Years ago he fled the isolated family estate of Usherland in the menacing North Carolina hills to pursue his writing career. He promised never to return. But his father's impending death has brought Rix back home to assume the role of Usher patriarch - and face his worst fears. </p> <p>His arrival forces him to confront a devious and impassive family and his vulnerable sister's slow descent into insanity. Stirring memories of the grim folktales born out of the surrounding Briartop Mountains and the terrifying legends of missing children, Rix knows that in the dark, twisted corridors of Usherland, that dreadful something he saw as a young boy is still there. It's waiting for him, as decayed and undying as the Usher heritage and more depraved than anything Poe could have imagined. </p> <p>This eerie novel by the Bram Stoker Award-winning author of <i>Swan Song</i> and <i>Boy's Life</i> is \"a frightening pleasure\" and a worthy tribute to the master who inspired it (<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>). </p>";
