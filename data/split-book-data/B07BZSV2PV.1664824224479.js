window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kellan Thorne loves the Christmas season above all else. He plans a well-deserved rest consisting of parties with friends and watching Christmas classics with Shannon. The Sentinel definitely wants to avoid anything more supernatural than the spirits seen by Dicken's Ebenezer Scrooge. However, fate has different plans for Kellan and his Soulborn who find themselves swept up with gods, goddesses, and mantles of immense power.</p> <p>As the eternal battle between order and chaos continues to play out, Kellan quickly finds himself at odds with forces beyond both his understanding and ability to control. Lucifer weaves new webs of intrigue with which he seeks to entrap both Meghan and Juliet and pits Maurius against Kellan at every turn.</p> <p>New and familiar allies put their lives on the line as an enigmatic Druid from Kellan's past promises the Sentinel power sufficient to make both the mountains of heaven and caverns of hell quake with fear. Such tremendous strength comes at a price which Kellan and Shannon must decide if they are willing to pay. To safeguard all those he holds dear, Kellan must breach a celestial treasury sealed shut at the dawn of creation and pull forth a wizard's soul.</p>";
