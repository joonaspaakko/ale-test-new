The games continue for days, until a champion is crowned—or all involved perish.</p> <p>When it becomes clear that to be a Free Trained pit fighter is to live with a mark on one’s head, four warriors struggle to change their lot, both in and out of the arena. But that’s easier said than done, and not everyone is pleased to learn of their plans. All the while, unseen forces watch the quartet, waiting for the best time to strike—and take everything they have.</p> <p>Perfect for fans of <i>Gladiator</i> and <i>A Game of Thrones</i>!</p>";
