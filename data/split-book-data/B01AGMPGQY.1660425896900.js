window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Dante Galand was just a boy, his father, Larsin, sailed away to make his fortune. And never returned. Since then, Dante has become a great sorcerer. A ruler. A destroyer of kings. And he's just learned that his father is living on a forbidden island at the edge of the known world. Where he's dying of a mysterious plague. </p> <p>In the company of his friend, the swordsman Blays, Dante travels to the island. There, his magic can do nothing for his father. As Dante and Blays quest for a cure - beset by strange beasts, angry spirits, and violent coastal raiders known as the Tauren - Dante falls sick, too. To save his father and himself, he'll have to rediscover the island's long-lost magic. But the hunt for its secrets leads Dante on a crash course with the Tauren - and island-wide civil war. And as he's away, an old threat begins to move against his homeland. </p> <p>Set in a <i>USA Today</i> best-selling world, <i>The Red Sea</i> is the first in a trilogy of warfare, sorcery, and friendship through the darkest times. </p>";
