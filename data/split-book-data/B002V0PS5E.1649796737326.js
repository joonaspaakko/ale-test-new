Earth has been invaded by a species that takes over the minds of human hosts while leaving their bodies intact, and most of humanity has succumbed. <p>Wanderer, the invading \"soul\" who has been given Melanie's body, knew about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the too vivid memories.
