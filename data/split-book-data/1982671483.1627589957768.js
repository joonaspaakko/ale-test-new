He wakes up at 3 a.m. and falls asleep at 4. Life is simple - until he hears a woman scream and sees a man leave the house across the street. But not just any man: the President of the United States.</p> <p><i>3:10 a.m.</i></p> <p>Henry hasn't seen his mother in 30 years. Now she's been found - at the bottom of the Potomac River. Henry soon learns everything he thought he knew about his mother was a lie. And that maybe his condition wasn't the reason she left all those years ago. Because Sally Bins was a spy.</p> <p><i>3:21 a.m.</i></p> <p>Henry Bins has traveled 3000 miles to see the sun. On June 21st in Fairbanks, Alaska, sunrise is at 3:07 a.m. Fourteen minutes later, 800 people will be dead.</p> <p><i>3:34 a.m.</i></p> <p>Was Henry really one of the CIA Sleep Control Program's first experiments? If his mother had caused his condition, could she reverse it? In his search for answers, Henry learns that everything - his condition, his parents, even the President-are linked by one thing: Project Sandman.</p> <p><i>3:46 a.m.</i></p> <p>Saturday, February 27, 2016. 3:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. It's the wedding that everyone has been waiting for....
