window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They say life is a bowl of cherries. Unfortunately, Daisy kept getting the pits.</b></p> <p>Escaping from deranged cyborgs and a malcontent artificial intelligence had been the run of Daisy’s life, but one from which she had miraculously come out the other side, and in one piece, no less. Unfortunately for her, she had survived that ordeal only to find herself in a far deeper mess.</p> <p>With an even more dangerous turn of events throwing her in harm’s way, Daisy’s original plight was now dwarfed by the new issues at hand. Issues involving not only her crew mates and herself, but threats on a global level. Earth was in jeopardy, and much as she hated to admit it, Daisy, it seemed, was its best hope.</p> <p>Driven into action and forced to rely not only on her own wits but also the voice in her head and tirelessly watching her back, Daisy found her newfound skills tested to their limits and quite nearly to their breaking point.</p> <p>Unfortunately for her adversaries, they didn’t know just who it was they were pushing around, because Daisy was most definitely not to be trifled with. She was the woman who pushed back.</p>";
