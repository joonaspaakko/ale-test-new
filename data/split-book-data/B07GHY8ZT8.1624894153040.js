Now I’m ready for a test.</p> <p>When a dark mage starts planting infernal bags around New York City, I get my wish. Like time bombs, the bags detonate without warning, spawning demonic beings that rip the souls of innocents from their bodies. And the attacks are accelerating.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a new wizard has come to town. A recent addition to the Order, Pierce is everything I’m not: refined, self-assured, and adept at magic. He even has Detective Vega blushing. If riling my resentment wasn’t enough, he’s trying to shoulder me out of my own case, stoking my suspicions.</p> <p>With the race to stop the dark mage growing more desperate by the minute, I need to prove that I’m the wizard to get it done - not Pierce. And without relying on my luck quotient.</p> <p>That saying about being careful what you wish for?</p> <p>It’s there for a reason.</p> <p><b>Prof Croft Series</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Preq 0: <i>Book of Souls</i></li> <li>Book 1: <i>Demon Moon</i></li> <li>Book 2: <i>Blood Deal</i></li> <li>Book 3: <i>Purge City</i></li> <li>Book 4: <i>Death Mage</i></li> <li>Book 5: <i>Black Luck</i></li> </ul>";
