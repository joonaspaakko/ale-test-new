Now, betrayed by her friends and framed for murder, she must flee beyond the reach of the Confederation...and any semblance of civilized society.</p> <p>With a damaged second-hand ship and TIC interceptors dogging her step, she nets a smuggling contract that might just get her back on her feet and in control of her destiny. But only if she's willing to make an ore run back to the place she's wanted for murder, and into the arms of the authorities...who somehow know she's coming.</p> <p>Written in Nathan Lowell's popular Trader's Tales and Seeker's Tales universe.</p>";
