window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a steel-and-lead-encased bunker 20 feet below the basement level of his house, a soldier waits for his final orders. On the surface, a plague ravages the planet, infecting over 90% of the populace. The bacterium burrows through the brain, destroying all signs of humanity and leaving behind little more than base, prehistoric instincts. The infected turn into hyper-aggressive predators, with an insatiable desire to kill and feed. Someday soon, the soldier will have to open the hatch to his bunker, and step out into this new wasteland, to complete his mission: <i>Subvenire refectus.</i> To rescue and rebuild. </p> <p><i>The Remaining</i> is the first book in the best-selling series, which tells a gritty tale of survival, perseverance and fighting to get back what has been lost.</p>";
