window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here starts an adventure that will span lifetimes and worlds. Discover where the story begins. Raymond E. Feist is an internationally best-selling author. My name is Pug. I was once an orphaned kitchen boy, with no family and no prospects, but I am destined to become a master magicianâ€¦. </p> <p>War is coming to the Kingdom of the Isles from another world, bringing with it chaos and destruction. Pug yearns to train as a warrior and fight for his kingdom alongside his foster-brother, Tomas, but instead he is forced to follow a different path: a path that will lead him right into the heart of the enemy. And one that will change the course of the war - and two worlds - forever. So begins the most epic series in fantasy fiction, a tale that will cross worlds and generations. <i>Magician</i> is the first book in the Riftwar Saga. The trilogy continues with book two, <i>Silverthorn</i>.</p>";
