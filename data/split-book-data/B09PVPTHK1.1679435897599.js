window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Swift. Silent. Deadly. Hunted.</p> <p>Recon Marine Conor McCall didnâ€™t expect action during his training op in the icy waters off Norway. But when a bizarre summer fog engulfed his boat, he and his team found themselves in a pitched fight against strange, cruel monsters emerging from the coastal depths of the North Sea. That was just the beginning.</p> <p>Stranded in a barren land of mountains, glaciers, and black pines, far from home and unable to contact the world they came from, the marines must prepare for war against murderous barbarians, wicked sorcerers, and foul creatures summoned from the oldest, deepest, and darkest pits of hell. When even their allies are enemies, the Recon Marines must do what they have always done: adapt or die. But with a world of ice and monsters seeking to destroy them, every second is mission-critical.</p> <p>US Marine Veteran Peter Nealen delivers a thrilling, action-packed WarGate adventure that blends the world-building of <i>Eaters of the Dead </i>with the gritty combat and real-life tactics of<i> Forgotten Ruin</i>.</p>";
