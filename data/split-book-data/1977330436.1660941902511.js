window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Broke, almost homeless, and recently fired. Those are my official reasons for answering a wanted ad for a skeevy-looking bartender gig.&nbsp;</p> <p>It went downhill the moment they asked me to do a trial shift instead of an interview - to see if I'd mesh with their \"special\" clientele. I think that part went great. Their customers were complete dickheads, and I was an asshole right back. That's the definition of fitting in, right?&nbsp;</p> <p>I expected to get thrown out on my ass. Instead, they...offered me the job?&nbsp;</p> <p>It turns out this place isn't a bar. It's a guild. And the three cocky guys I drenched with a margarita during my trial? Yeah, they were mages. Either I'm exactly the kind of takes-no-sh-t bartender this guild needs, or there's a good reason no one else wants to work here.&nbsp;</p> <p>So what's a broke girl to do? Take the job, of course - with a pay raise.&nbsp;</p> <p>Make sure to check out the companion series, The Guild Codex: Demonized, available now, and The Guild Codex: Warped, coauthored by Rob Jacobsen.</p>";
