Unlike most newcomers, Jason isn’t looking for a job in oil and gas: he’s a half-fae changeling that wants to get away from the politics of the inhuman races.</p> <p>He soon learns that despite being a supernatural backwater, the city is run by a near-godlike Wizard - and the shadows are full of unseen dangers.
