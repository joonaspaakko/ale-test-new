window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get ready for white-knuckled listening. Greaney's debut novel - and future feature film - introduces the enigmatic and elusive Court Gentry, a former CIA operative and a legendary hired gun. With a terrifying ability to vaporize targets and a strict moral code, he stalks the gray margins of the world, moving silently from job to job, accomplishing the impossible, then fading away. When his government and former employers turn on him, there is no safehouse to run to, no way to lie low. In a constant state of escape and pursuit, Gentry tears through the Middle East and Europe in a riveting life-or-death race against time. </p> <p>Fast-paced, well-researched, and fun, <i>The Gray Man</i> is already being adapted for a movie by the company behind Tom Cruise's <i>Knight &amp; Day</i>.</p>";
