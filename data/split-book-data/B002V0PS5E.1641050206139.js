window.bookSummaryJSON = "Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away. Earth has been invaded by a species that takes over the minds of human hosts while leaving their bodies intact, and most of humanity has succumbed. <p>Wanderer, the invading \"soul\" who has been given Melanie's body, knew about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the too vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.</p> <p>Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of the man Melanie loves - Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer yearns for a man she's never met. As outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off to search for the man they both love.</p> <p>Featuring what may be the first love triangle involving only two bodies, <i>The Host</i> is a riveting and unforgettable novel that will bring a vast new readership to one of the most compelling writers of our time.</p>";
