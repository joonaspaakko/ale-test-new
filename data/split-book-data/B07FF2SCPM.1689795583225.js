Still others say the gateway to that greater reality was and is only the stuff of dreams.&nbsp;</p> <p>They are all wrong. Rachelle Matthews, who grew up in the small town of Eden, Utah, discovered just how wrong when she dreamed and awoke in another world. There she learned she was the 49th Mystic, the prophesied one, tasked with finding five ancient seals before powerful enemies destroy her.&nbsp;</p> <p>If Rachelle succeeds in her quest, peace will reign. If she fails, the world will forever be locked in darkness.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The 49th Mystic</i>, Rachelle found the first three of those five seals through great peril and mind-altering adventure. But two seals remain hidden, and the fate of both worlds hangs in their balance.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Rachelle Matthews sits deep in a dungeon, Vlad Smith is just getting started. Thomas Hunter's world is about to be turned inside out.
