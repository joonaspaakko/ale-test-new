The kid has no idea what she's getting herself into...You can find anything in the Nightside-if it doesn't find you first.\"</p> <p>John Taylor is not a private detective per se, but he has a knack for finding lost things. That's why he's been hired to descend into the Nightside, an otherworldly realm in the center of London where fantasy and reality share renting space and the sun never shines.</p>";
