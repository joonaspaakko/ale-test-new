window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They thought they survived the extinction cycle, but a powerful evil lurks in the shadows...</b>Now old and new heroes join forces to save whatâ€™s left of the world in this thrilling sci-fi audio adventure.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eight years ago, an engineered virus ravaged the globe, infecting and transforming humans into apex predators called Variants. Billions died, civilization collapsed, and the human race teetered on the brink of extinction. Nations banded together and heroes rose up to fight these abominations. On the front lines, Captain Reed Beckham and Master Sergeant Joe \"Fitz\" Fitzpatrick of Delta Force Team Ghost fought against the Variant hordes. With the aid of CDC Doctor Kate Lovato, they helped lead humanity to victory.</p> <p>Now, almost a decade after the end of the war, civilization has slowly clawed toward recovery. In the Allied States of America, survivors live in outposts where they have rebuilt industry, agriculture, and infrastructure. The remaining Variants are believed to be dying off under destroyed cities and the abandoned frontier. But evil and intelligent forces dwell in the shadows with the starving beasts, scheming to restart the extinction cycle and end humanity forever. And once again, Beckham, Fitz, and Kate will rise to fight them, along with new heroes to try and save what remains of the world.</p> <p>R. C. Bray brings to life the beloved characters of this series and expertly depicts their turmoil and struggle for survival.</p> <p><b>Note: </b>This new season is a self-contained storyline. Listeners do not have to hear the first seven books of the <i>Extinction Cycle</i> to jump into book one of <i>Extinction Cycle: Dark Age.</i> For returning listeners, this audiobook takes place after book seven, <i>Extinction War.</i>&nbsp;</p>";
