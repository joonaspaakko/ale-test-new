Worse, she has killed the son of their chief.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, with the Wolf People vowing revenge and her people facing annihilation, River must do the impossible. She must prove herself as priestess. She must find the mythical Sky People.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Sky People</i> is a fast-paced novella of revenge and redemption that explores new territory for number-one international best seller Terry Goodkind.</p>";
