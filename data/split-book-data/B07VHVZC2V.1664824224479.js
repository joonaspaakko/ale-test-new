window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dustin Graves has three days to live.</p> <p>The darkling mage has found himself in the company of scoundrels. Maybe thatâ€™s what Dustin deserves: a werewolf, a vampire, and a talking sword for teammates, and a rogue sorcerer as his mentor and master.</p> <p>But a doomsday cult has surfaced. Twelve mutilated bodies are found drowned in blood and in wine. The massacre stinks of both the divine and the supernatural. Worst of all, an ancient god sends Dust on a lethal mission, one he must complete in three days. The reward? He gets to live. Well...maybe.</p> <p>If you like snarky heroes, snappy dialogue, and a bit of grit and gore, you'll love the second book in Nazri Noor's series of urban fantasy novels. Explore the darkling mage universe and discover <i>Dark Harvest</i> today.</p>";
