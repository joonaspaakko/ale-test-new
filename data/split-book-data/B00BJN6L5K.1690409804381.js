With the fate of humanity in the balance, Zoe will be forced to renew family ties and pit her own supernatural abilities against a dark and nefarious foe. </p> <p>At once captivating, deftly worded, and character-rich, <i>Seven Kinds of Hell</i> expands vampire legend and werewolf noir in both intensity and charismatic bite.</p>";
