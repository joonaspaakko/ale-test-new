I was little more than flesh and bone, weary to my very soul. </p> <p>So, of course, there was a knock at the door. </p> <p>My smile faded, happy face turning to tears, as Kate - a gorgeous vampire and the woman I lust over at every available opportunity - told me the news. Dark magic came to me as my eyes snapped to black and my tattoos felt fit to burst with the energy they channeled. </p> <p>I'm Faz Pound, a.k.a. Black Spark, Dark Magic Enforcer, and a goddamn wizard! </p> <p>I'll tear apart hell itself to get at anyone or anything that dares hurt the people I care about. Nobody messes with me or mine and lives. Nobody. </p> <p>Things are about to get nasty. </p>";
