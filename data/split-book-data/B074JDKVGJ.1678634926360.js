window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'd had it with magic. Me and it were no longer friends. </p> <p>This addict went cold turkey. Five years I'd been clean for, not even a taste of the good stuff. No longer a space cadet. </p> <p>Life was quiet, life was good. Life was as boring as a conference on boring hosted by Professor Boring McBoring from Boringsville University. So, I have to admit, that when I got drawn back into the Hidden world I wasn't as reluctant as I made out. </p> <p>What I wasn't expecting was having to deal with a dragon holding the dwarves' gold hostage, accidentally unleashing a maniac on the city, and fighting for my life as everything goes into free fall. Oh, plus I've got myself lumbered with a rather keen wizard-in-training. </p> <p>Now I'm almost out of time, certainly out of luck, but I have responsibilities and I will fight until the bitter end. Problem being, the end is looking decidedly nasty, and a blast from our collective past threatens to leave the entire world a barren wasteland. </p> <p>Hi, I'm Faz Pound, and, once again, you can call me Black Spark, Dark Magic Enforcer. </p> <p>I'm also considering swearing off the magic again. </p> <p>Maybe. </p>";
