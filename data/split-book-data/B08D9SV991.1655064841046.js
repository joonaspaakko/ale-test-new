window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the spring of 1903, the 311, known to locals as “The Majestic”, carried more than 100 passengers on board toward a tunnel mouth that would allow the 13-car locomotive to pass safely through the underbelly of the Canadian Rockies.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tunnel swallowed the 311 whole, and the train - and everyone on it - were never seen again.&nbsp;</p> <p>Search parties scoured the tunnel length with torches, searching for clues as to the big engine’s fate. During that search, some of the men swore they heard a ghostly whistle echoing in the cold Albertan dark. The only thing they found, however, was a lady’s hand fan with an Oriental design, spread wide like a butterfly’s wing.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the winter of 1910, just after a snowy sundown, the Leland Baxter gang, a collection of cattle thieves, gunmen, and cutthroats, wait on horses before a tunnel exit. They wait for the 5409, which secretly carries a train car full of railway cash - wages destined for workers of the copper and gold mines of British Columbia.&nbsp;</p> <p>A payroll they intend to rob.</p> <p>What they will discover, however, is that the approaching train isn’t the 5409. It’s the missing 311, the train only whispered about around dying campfires. A train that some believe still rides the iron rails, traveling to places no mortal should ever go, seeing things no one should ever see.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those men will climb aboard the 311...and will soon realize two sinister truths about the train.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 311 doesn’t ever stop.&nbsp;</p> <p>And no one ever gets off.&nbsp;</p> <p>A very weird Western.&nbsp;</p> <p>Approx 119,000 words. Contains violence, coarse language, and some elements of horror.&nbsp;</p>";
