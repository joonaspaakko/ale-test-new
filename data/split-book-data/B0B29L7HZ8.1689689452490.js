To top it off, another young man from Simon's village discovers that he's a savior prophesied to destroy evil and save the realm.</p> <p>Prophecy has nothing to say about Simon. He has no special powers, no magical weapons, and no guarantee that he'll survive. But he sets off anyway, alone, to gain the power he needs to oppose the Travelers and topple their ruthless Overlord. It may not be his destiny, but Simon's determined to rescue his fellow villagers from certain death.</p> <p>Because who cares about prophecy, really?</p>";
