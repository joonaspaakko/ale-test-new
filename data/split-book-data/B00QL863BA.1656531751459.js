window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Seth Grahame-Smith returns with the follow-up to <i>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</i> - a sweeping, alternate history of 20th Century America as seen through the eyes of vampire Henry Sturges. </p> <p><i>The Last American Vampire<i> </i></i></p> <p><i><i>In Reconstruction-era America, vampire Henry Sturges is searching for renewed purpose in the wake of his friend Abraham Lincoln's shocking death. It will be an expansive journey that will first send him to England for an unexpected encounter with Jack the Ripper, then to New York City for the birth of a new American century, the dawn of the electric era of Tesla and Edison, and the blazing disaster of the 1937 Hindenburg crash. Along the way, Henry goes on the road in a Kerouac-influenced trip as Seth Grahame-Smith ingeniously weaves vampire history through Russia's October Revolution, the First and Second World Wars, and the JFK assassination. </i></i></p> <p><i><i>Expansive in scope and serious in execution, <i>The Last American Vampire</i> is sure to appeal to the passionate listeners who made Abraham </i>Lincoln: Vampire Hunter<i> a runaway success.</i></i></p>";
