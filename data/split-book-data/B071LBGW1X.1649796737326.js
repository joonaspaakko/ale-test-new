window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you lost a piece of your memory... </p> <p>Would you trust yourself to have made the right choices... </p> <p>In the moments you can't remember. </p> <p>The Ferox assault has been escalating, drawing Jonathan into combat more and more frequently. With each passing day, he's grown stronger. He can't be certain, but his attackers seem to be getting...more dangerous? </p> <p>...and, of course, Heyer is gone, again. </p> <p>Then came the glitch. Unexpectedly pulled from battle, Jonathan finds he cannot recall the final moments of his last confrontation. Convinced that his memory loss was no accident, he must uncover the truth. </p> <p>His only leads are a less than helpful artificial alien intelligence, and Rylee, a mysterious and possibly crazy woman, who seems to think they share a history he doesn't remember. </p> <p>With no means to contact the only being who can give him answers, and knowing he has gaps in his memory, Jonathan must make every move uncertain of the consequences. The blonde man better show up soon, because events hidden in Jonathan's lost memories may trigger a war humanity isn't ready to fight. </p> <p><i>The Never Paradox</i> is book two in The Chronicles of Jonathan Tibbs, listeners who have not yet completed book one, <i>The Never Hero</i>, will have difficulty following. </p> <p>Parental Warning: This series attempts to keep swearing to a minimum. However, the sequel has one unavoidable usage of the F-word. This is due to its presence in a direct quote taken from another piece of fiction. </p>";
