window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Semi-finalist - The Kindle Book Review, Best Indie Books of 2012</b> </p> <p>\"The first book in the best-selling Elemental Mysteries series by Elizabeth Hunter, <i>Elemental Mysteries</i> has turned into one of the best paranormal series I've read this year. It's sharp, elegant, clever, evenly paced without dragging its feet, and at the same time emotionally intense.\" <br>â€”Nocturnal Book Reviews </p> <p>No secret stays hidden forever. A phone call from an old friend sets mysterious book researcher Giovanni Vecchio back on the path of a mystery that has eluded him for centuries. Little does he suspect a young librarian holds the key to an ancient secret, nor could he expect the danger Beatrice De Novo would attract. Now both will follow a twisted maze leading from the archives of a university library, through the fires of Renaissance Florence, and toward a passion that could destroy them both.</p>";
