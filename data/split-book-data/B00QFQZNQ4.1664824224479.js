Usually, it's something mundane like a suicide gone wrong or someone revived that shouldn'ta been.\" </p> <p>Carlos Delacruz is one of the New York Council of the Dead's most unusual agents - an inbetweener, partially resurrected from a death he barely recalls suffering, after a life that's missing from his memory. He thinks he is one of a kind - until he encounters other entities walking the fine line between life and death. One inbetweener is a sorcerer. He's summoned a horde of implike ngks capable of eliminating spirits, and they're spreading through the city like a plague. They've already taken out some of NYCOD's finest, leaving Carlos desperate to stop their master before he opens up the entrada to the Underworld - which would destroy the balance between the living and the dead. But in uncovering this man's identity, Carlos confronts the truth of his own life - and death...</p>";
