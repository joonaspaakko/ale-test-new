window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The third thrilling book in the increasingly popular Murderbot Diaries, which began with </b><b><i>All Systems Red</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Sci-fi's favorite antisocial AI is back on a mission. The case against the too-big-to-fail GrayCris Corporation is floundering, and more importantly, authorities are beginning to ask more questions about where Dr. Mensah's SecUnit is.&nbsp;</p> <p>And Murderbot would rather those questions went away. For good.&nbsp;</p> <p>Martha Wells' <i>Rogue Protocol </i>is the third in the Murderbot Diaries series, starring a humanlike android who keeps getting sucked back into adventure after adventure, though it just wants to be left alone, away from humanity and small talk.&nbsp;</p> <p>Listen to <i>Rogue Protocol </i>and find out why Hugo Award winner Ann Leckie wrote, \"I love Murderbot!\"</p>";
