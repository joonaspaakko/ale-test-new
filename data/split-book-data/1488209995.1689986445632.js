window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Enjoyable, entertaining, engaging fantasy.” (Tor.com)</p> <p>At the Emperor's Command</p> <p>Multiple races carefully navigate the City of Elantra under the Dragon Emperor’s wing. His Imperial Wolves are executioners, the smallest group to serve in the Halls of Law. The populace calls them assassins.</p> <p>Every wolf candidate must consent to a full examination by the Tha’alani, one of the most feared and distrusted races in Elantra for their ability to read minds. Most candidates don’t finish their job interviews.</p> <p>Severn Handred, the newest potential recruit, is determined to face and pass this final test — even if by doing so he’s exposing secrets he has never shared.</p> <p>When an interrogation uncovers the connections to a two-decade-old series of murders of the Tha’alani, the Wolves are commanded to hunt. Severn’s first job will be joining the chase. From the High Halls to the Tha’alani quarter, from the Oracles to the Emperor, secrets are uncovered, tensions are raised and justice just might be done…if Severn can survive.</p> <p>The Wolves of Elantra</p> <p>Book 1: <i>The Emperor’s Wolves </i></p>";
