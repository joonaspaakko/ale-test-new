Only the janissaries can stand against them. Their&nbsp;living legend, Kevah, once beheaded a magus amid a hail of ice daggers. But ever since his wife disappeared, he spends his days in a haze of hashish and poetry.</p> <p>To save the kingdom, Kevah must conquer his grief and become the legend he once was. But Micah writes his own legend in blood, and his righteous conquest will stop at nothing. When the gods choose sides, a legend will be etched upon the stars.<br> <br> <i>Game of Thrones</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Arabian Nights</i> in&nbsp;this blood-soaked epic fantasy inspired by The Crusades, featuring Lovecraftian gods, mischievous djinns, and astral magic.</p>";
