Sure, no one else remembers Bobby Kennedy was president or that time an alien took over the TV to declare war, but what's that in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp;</p> <p>Then one day Faer remembers something that he can't shrug off: his own death in 1968.</p> <p>It turns out the Time Warp isn't just a song in <i>Rocky Horror</i>. Faer finds himself stranded in the past with a shape-shifting alien and an apparition of his best friend. An unearthly decree is made before Faer can sort out how to get home: Save yourself, then save the world.</p> <p><i>Tear in Time</i> is an adult speculative fiction novel.</p>";
