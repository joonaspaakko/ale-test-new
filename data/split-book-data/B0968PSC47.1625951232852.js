window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John, Chris, and Erik are neighbors in the quaint subdivision of The Creeks of Sage Valley Phase II. The three men happily live the typical suburban family life. But, itâ€™s not all birthday parties and bounce houses.</p> <p>These men struggle every day to fulfill their roles as fathers, friends, and husbands. They face challenges like grocery shopping under pressure, learning to be the Tooth Fairy, and competing for Halloween bragging rights. Throw in Santa and the HOA, and it all adds up to a whole lot of crap.&nbsp;</p> <p>This handsome volume includes:&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Dad vs. the Grocery Store</i></b> - John would rather sit and watch the game, but his wife needs some things at the store. Can he complete the list and get back in time to see the end of the game?&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Dad vs. Halloween</i></b> - Every Halloween, Chris has the scariest house on the block and gives out the best candy. But this year, someone is showing him up, and he'll stop at nothing to find out who.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Dad vs. Santa</i></b> - Erik has planned the perfect Christmas for his family. The plan is foolproof, bulletproof, and flame retardant. Nothing can undo the hours of planning and preparation. Nothing except maybe odd-shaped packages, ill-timed fruitcakes, or an errant neighborhood Santa Claus.</p> <p><b><i>Dad vs. the Tooth Fairy</i></b> - Erik always has a plan, and he's sure he would have figured out the whole Tooth Fairy thing, eventually. But, when his three-year-old son takes a frisbee to the mouth, he's forced to speed things up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Between neighborhood kids with big mouths and unhelpful dentists, he's going to need to improvise. Will he bend to the pressure of inflation? Will he get caught in the act? And, what do you do with those teeth anyway?&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Dad vs. the HOA</i></b><b> (a novella)</b> - There comes a time in every man's life when he must stand for the things he believes in. John doesn't believe in bagging his grass. So, when a new allergy-prone neighbor gets the HOA to require it, there's only one thing he can do - run for president of The Creeks of Sage Valley Phase II.&nbsp;</p> <p>John, Chris, and Erik put aside most of their differences to run a campaign that they hope will see John elected as president and end the meddling of the rule-loving new kid on the block.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will they succeed? It's doubtful.</p>";
