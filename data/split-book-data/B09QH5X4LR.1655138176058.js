But they'll need to master magic and temper their bodies to survive. In a world where your personal strength is your greatest value, Erik and Rugrat have to start from the bottom. But they've cut their teeth in conflicts all across Earth and honed their skills over years of training while creating a bond and upholding their honors and oaths.</p> <p>It's not a question of if they are ready for the 10 realms, but instead are the 10 realms ready for them?</p> <p>Get it now.</p>";
