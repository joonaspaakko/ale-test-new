But FBI consultant Dr. Jeffrey Ailes' discovery of an old magic magazine will turn Jessica's world upside down. Faced with a crime that appears beyond explanation, Ailes has nothing to lose - and everything to gain - by taking a chance on an agent raised in a world devoted to achieving the seemingly impossible. </p> <p>The body in the cemetery is only the first in the Warlock's series of dark miracles. Thrust into the media spotlight, with time ticking away until the next crime, can Jessica confront her past to stop a depraved killer? If she can't, she may become his next victim.</p>";
