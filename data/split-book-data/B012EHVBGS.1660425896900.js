Amid a forest where the shades of the dead linger all around, every homesteader knows to follow the Simple Rules: \"Don't kindle flame, don't shed the blood of another, don't run at night.

And to protect her family from a murderous gang with high bounties on their heads, Silence will break every rule again, at the risk of becoming a shade herself. </p>";
