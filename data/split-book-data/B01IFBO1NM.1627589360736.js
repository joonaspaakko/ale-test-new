That's my name, I suppose. It's easier for the humans to remember than 413s98-itr8. I guess I've gotten used to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rob Dircks, author of <i>Where the Hell is Tesla?</i> and <i>Don’t Touch the Blue Stuff!</i>, has a \"unit\" with a problem: how to deliver his package, out in the middle of nowhere, with nothing to guide him. Oh, and with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance. It's a science fiction tale of technology gone haywire, unlikely heroes, and the nature of humanity. (Woah. That last part sounds deep. Don't worry, it's not.)&nbsp;</p>";
