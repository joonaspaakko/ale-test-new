Hot steel, demonic magic, and the loss of those he loved. </p> <p>After escaping the horrors of Arkum Zul, Kael and his companions survive a terror-filled night on the ocean only to find themselves shipwrecked and stranded in the Wildlands. With forest tribals on the warpath and old enemies roaming the forest, Kael struggles to come to terms with what he is slowly becoming - a killer. A DeathWizard. </p> <p>In the fight against the evil that threatens to consume him, Kael learns that the Dwarven Mountains far to the north may hide an ancient monolith that holds the answer to the corruption that flows in his veins. </p> <p>But trekking across Talohna is a dangerous prospect. It is a world that holds its secrets close. The cost of uncovering them may very well be his soul and, quite possibly, his life. </p>";
