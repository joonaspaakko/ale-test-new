Definitely mistake number two. </p> <p>Now I've lost count of my bad choices, same as I have the bodies, as they're piling up faster than a troll after free chalk. </p> <p>As I get to grips with this new magic I've been gifted, the city remains under a spell of violence, and it's down to yours truly to deal with it. But I'm a noob at this job, ill-prepared and with my own personal demons to fight. </p> <p>My hunger is taking hold as the vampire nature encroaches, the need to feed impossible to resist, and my inherited magic is so volatile it's practically splitting me apart.
