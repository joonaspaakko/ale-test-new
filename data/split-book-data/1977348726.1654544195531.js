They were wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The beast came at night. Murdered the cop in his home. Tore his Rottweilers to pieces. And it's only the latest in a series of gruesome attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Overwhelmed, Houston PD is at a loss. But shape-shifter Michael Biörn isn't. Michael discerns the secret nature of the killer; a werewolf's handiwork is unmistakable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Werewolves move in packs, however. And the local pack is 40 members strong. But a young woman's life is at stake. And so, after centuries spent avoiding the wolves, Michael abandons his retreat to confront his ancestral enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To succeed, Michael must untangle the intricate web of lies and deceit surrounding the case. Fortunately, he can count on his friends for help. Friends like Ezekiel, a wizard of the Second Circle, and Sheila, an attractive journalist who uncovered his true nature. A nature she doesn't find particularly repelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
