Worse, my boyfriend of five years just dumped me.</p> <p>What do I do? I move in with my three eccentric aunts in their family home, Davenport House. Sounds exciting, only this massive farmhouse likes to eat men.</p> <p>If I were a regular human, I would have run out screaming like a banshee. As a witch - I do absolutely nothing. Hey, maybe they deserved it?</p> <p>I'm back in Hollow Cove, the flamboyant paranormal community, where nymphs, werewolves, trolls, shifters, witches, and other paranormals live comfortable lives away from prying human eyes. As I settle into my new life, I decide to accept my aunts' proposal and join the family business - the business of protecting our town and killing anything that would want to harm it. But I've been away from the paranormal world for quite some time, and my magical abilities are a little bit rusty. Heck, they're practically invisible.</p> <p>Things soon spiral down the crapper when people in our community start dropping like flies. And when demons start showing up in Hollow Cove, it's up to me to take care of them. Permanently.</p> <p>This is going to be awesome. I just know it.</p>";
