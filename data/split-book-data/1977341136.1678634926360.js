Unfortunately, he loves adventure even more than she loves being left alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>She doesn't want to investigate a malignant spell in a haunted house, but Sebastian is promising rare books as the reward. She also doesn't want to hurt her family but is tired of being lied to about her past. And she definitely doesn't want to get stuck in a dangerously unstable time loop, but Sebastian is in trouble - again....</p> <p>Strangling her friend, as satisfying as it would be, won't fix her problems. If she wants answers and to not miss tea, she had best find the right spell for the job - before everything goes to hell and takes them all with it.</p>";
