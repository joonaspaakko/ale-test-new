Broken, altered, and tormented by all that has befallen him, he is driven to wreak vengeance upon those who assume him dead...by any means necessary.</p> <p>Fans of Cormac McCarthy’s <i>The Road</i> or Emily St. John Mandel’s <i>Station Eleven</i> will enjoy the raw, emotional pull of debut author Peter Hackshaw’s writing.</p>";
