window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A not-quite epic science fiction adventure about a down-on-his luck galactic pilot caught in a cross-galaxy struggle for survival!&nbsp;</p> <p>Space travel just isn't what it used to be. With the invention of quantum teleportation, space heroes aren't needed anymore. When one particularly unlucky ex-adventurer masquerades as famous pilot and hate figure Jacques McKeown, he's sucked into an ever-deepening corporate and political intrigue. Between space pirates, adorable deadly creatures, and a missing fortune in royalties, saving the universe was never this difficult!&nbsp;</p> <p>From the creator of <i>Mogworld</i> and <i>Jam</i>! Benjamin Richard \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw is a British Australian comedic writer, video game journalist, author, and video game developer.
