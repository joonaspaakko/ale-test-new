window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a darkened room a young man sits telling the macabre and eerie story of his life - the story of a vampire, gifted with eternal life, cursed with an exquisite craving for human blood. </p> <p>Anne Rice's compulsively readable novel is arguably the most celebrated work of vampire fiction since Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> which was published in 1897. </p> <p>As the Washington Post said on its first publication, it is a 'thrilling, strikingly original work of the imagination . . . sometimes horrible, sometimes beautiful, always unforgettable'. </p>";
