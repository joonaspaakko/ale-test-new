window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sweeping tale of revolution and wonder in a world not quite like our own, </b><b><i>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</i></b><b> is a genre-defying story of magic, war, and the struggle for freedom in the early modern world.</b></p> <p>It is the Age of Enlightenment - of new and magical political movements, from the necromancer Robespierre calling for revolution in France, to the weather mage Toussaint L'Ouverture leading the slaves of Haiti in their fight for freedom, to the bold new Prime Minister William Pitt weighing the legalization of magic among commoners in Britain and abolition throughout its colonies overseas.</p> <p>But amid all of the upheaval of the early modern world, there is an unknown force inciting all of human civilization into violent conflict. And it will require the combined efforts of revolutionaries, magicians, and abolitionists to unmask this hidden enemy before the whole world falls to darkness and chaos.</p> <p>For more from H. G.
