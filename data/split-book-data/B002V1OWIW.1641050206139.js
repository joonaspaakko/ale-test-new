window.bookSummaryJSON = "From David Mitchell, the Booker Prize nominee, award-winning writer, and one of the featured authors in Granta's <i>Best of Young British Novelists 2003</i> issue, comes his highly anticipated third novel, a work of mind-bending imagination and scope. <p>A reluctant voyager crossing the Pacific in 1850; a disinherited composer blagging a precarious livelihood in between-the-wars Belgium; a high-minded journalist in Governor Reagan's California; a vanity publisher fleeing his gangland creditors; a genetically modified \"dinery server\" on death-row; and Zachry, a young Pacific Islander witnessing the nightfall of science and civilization: the narrators of <i>Cloud Atlas</i> hear each other's echoes down the corridor of history, and their destinies are changed in ways great and small.</p> <p>In his captivating third novel, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, David Mitchell erases the boundaries of language, genre, and time to offer a meditation on humanity's dangerous will to power, and where it may lead us.</p>";
