window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Fourth in the \"flawless\" (<i>The Reading Caf√©</i>) </i>New York Times<i> best-selling series from the author of </i>Vision in Silver. </p> <p><b>For centuries, the Others and humans have lived side by side in uneasy peace. But when humankind oversteps its bounds, the Others will have to decide how much humanity they're willing to tolerate - both within themselves and within their community.... </b> </p> <p>Since the Others allied themselves with the <i>cassandra sangue</i>, the fragile yet powerful human blood prophets who were being exploited by their own kind, the delicate dynamic between humans and Others changed. Some, like Simon Wolfgard, wolf shifter and leader of the Lakeside Courtyard, and blood prophet Meg Corbyn see the new closer companionship as beneficial - both personally and practically. </p> <p>But not everyone is convinced. A group of radical humans is seeking to usurp land through a series of violent attacks on the Others. What they don't realize is that there are older and more dangerous forces than shifters and vampires protecting the land that belongs to the Others - and those forces are willing to do whatever is necessary to protect what is theirs.... </p>";
