window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kellan Thorne labors beneath the burden of Chaos he accepted in order to both save Shannon and destroy the previous Sentinel of Chaos. Now he is trapped in the brutal life of a slave and gladiator within Claudius’ Rome.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in 2020, Shannon McLeod Thorne struggles with both the loss of her husband and the responsibilities of being Creation’s new Sentinel of Order. Almost six months have passed since she pushed Kellan through the portal in Fingal’s Cavern, and she has begun to lose hope. However, like many times before, strange events conspire to cast light in dark places.</p> <p>The first glimmer comes from James Clinton and his AI friend Jarvis who believe they can break the code surrounding Kellan’s mysterious disappearance. Shannon, Meghan, and the Council of Havilah use this new found information to try and summon an enigmatic Mantle of unimaginable power. However, in doing so, they risk bringing down upon themselves the very Incarnation of Destruction.</p> <p>Even if they succeed in avoiding this Incarnation’s grasp and enlisting the Mantle’s help to retrieve Kellan from ancient Rome, how will his friends save the new Sentinel of Chaos from himself.</p>";
