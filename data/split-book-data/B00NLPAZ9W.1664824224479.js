window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something strange is happening at the Orsk furniture superstore in Cleveland. Every morning, employees arrive to find broken Kjerring wardrobes, shattered Brooka glassware, and vandalized Liripip sofa beds - clearly someone, or something, is up to no good. To unravel the mystery, five young employees volunteer for a long dusk-till-dawn shift and encounter horrors that defy imagination. Along the way, author Grady Hendrix infuses sly social commentary on the nature of work in the new 21st-century economy. </p> <p>A traditional haunted house story in a contemporary setting, and full of current fears, <i>Horrorstör</i> delivers a high-concept premise in a unique style. </p>";
