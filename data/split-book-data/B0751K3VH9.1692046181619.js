window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Desil has spent his life training, but a promise to his mother has kept him from using his abilities for anything worthwhile. Now all he does is help his mother manage her tavern as his father rests in a grave. Desil knows there's at least one other mage somewhere in this territory who can do what he can; they share a connection through their magic, although they've never met. He stays up nights wondering what they might be able to accomplish together. </p> <p>When an opportunity to not only meet this mage but change the course of his future finally presents itself, Desil jumps at the chance. A great leader has disappeared, leaving clues that only Desil and this other mage can see. War is coming, and following the clues could mark Desil as a traitor, but he trained his whole life for something. If this isn't it, then what is? He might unearth a new power capable of ending war, or he might die trying. Either is better than doing nothing. </p>";
