window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The follow-up to the hugely popular science fiction action-adventure </b><b><i>All Systems Red </i></b></p> <p><i>Artificial Condition</i> continues The Murderbot Diaries, a science fiction series that tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. It appeals to fans of <i>Westworld</i>, <i>Ex Machina</i>, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans. \"As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure.\"</p> <p>It has a dark past - one in which a number of humans were killed. A past that caused it to christen itself \"Murderbot.\" But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more.</p> <p>Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don't want to know what the \"A\" stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue.</p> <p>What it discovers will forever change the way it thinks.</p>";
