window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A murdered teen is resurrected to walk the Earth for centuries in this sweeping historical epic in the spirit of <i>The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing</i> and <i>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>, from the author of <i>Rotters</i> and <i>Scowler</i>. </p> <p>Twenty minutes after his murder on the shores of Lake Michigan in 1896, 17-year-old Zebulon Finch awakens, resurrected to suffer an eternity upon the planet. But of all people...why him? </p> <p>Is it because he was a violent Chicago gangster and this is his chance at redemption? </p> <p>Is it because he is a modern-day Job whose suffering is beyond human comprehension? </p> <p>Over the next century - or two - he will try to find out. With a sly, aristocratic voice and a healthy appetite for women and anarchy, Zebulon Finch spins a tale of his travels across a young America, watching the country grow and mature, knowing that his mind and body will never do the same. </p> <p>Yes, he is witty. He is also vain. Absolutely brilliant, too. And he is always entertaining. But have no doubt - Zebulon Finch has a heart as vulnerable as anyone's. Too bad he doesn't learn to use it till after it has stopped beating.... </p>";
