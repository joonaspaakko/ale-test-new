window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Narrator Suzy Jackson's assured, brassy tones and forceful delivery are an exceptional match for Sanderson's high-stakes, battle-driven space opera.... Jackson's gift for characterizations shines - she brings out the humor and heroism in Spensa's young classmates and friends (and the neurotic spaceship MBOT), along with the pain and perseverance of the generations that came before them. This is a high-octane futuristic narrative of hope, sacrifice, and courage, and a fast pace speaks to the rising urgency as war rages above the planet. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\" (<i>AudioFile</i> magazine)</p> <p>From Brandon Sanderson, the number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Reckoners series, <i>Words of Radiance</i>, and the internationally best-selling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.</p>";
