window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She was born in poverty, in a dusty village under the equatorial sun. She does not remember her mother, she does not remember her own name, her earliest clear memory is of the day her father sold her to the tall pale man. In the Court of the Pomegranate Tree, where she was taught the ways of a courtesan and the skills of an assassin, she was named Emerald, the precious jewel of the Undying Duke's collection of beauties. She calls herself Green.</p> <p>The world she inhabits is one of political power and magic, where Gods meddle in the affairs of mortals. At the center of it is the immortal Duke's city of Copper Downs, which controls all the trade on the Storm Sea. Green has made many enemies, and some secret friends, and she has become a very dangerous woman indeed.</p> <p>Acclaimed author Jay Lake has created a remarkable character in <i>Green</i> and evokes a remarkable world in this novel. Green and her struggle to survive and find her own past will live in the readers mind for a long time.</p>";
