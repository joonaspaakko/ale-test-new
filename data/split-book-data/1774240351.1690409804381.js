window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dominic Moretti was dealing with a lot of issues. Life hadn’t been easy since returning home from Afghanistan. His marriage was on the rocks, his sports betting was out of control, and he was hanging out with the wrong cronies in Manhattan’s Little Italy - just another war hero who couldn’t piece his life back together in the real world. Also, there was that strange, annoying feeling that he was being watched....</p> <p>Humankind was indeed being evaluated, by the highly advanced Khantam Lom, an alien species in control of much of the galaxy. Did this selfish, war-mongering, human race warrant protection from the soon-to be-invading Wikk Empire? An insectile species with insatiable appetites, the Wikk were hell-bent on subjugating Earth as one of their many farming settlements.</p> <p>So the adventure begins. Dominic inadvertently saves the life of a Khantam Lom Observer, and everything changes. Humankind has but one - seeming impossible - shot at avoiding a catastrophic fate. Dominic won’t be able to do it alone, but will the ragtag team he’s assembled be enough? Will any of them survive long enough to make a difference?</p>";
