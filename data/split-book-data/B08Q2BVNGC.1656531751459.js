The Paternus Trilogy is a powerhouse urban fantasy that explores the very edge of possibility of what this subgenre can offer, and it is glorious. Highly, highly recommended.” (Novel Notions)</p> <p><b>Even myths have legends.

The final battle of the world’s oldest war has begun.</p> <p><b>Book 2: </b><b><i>Paternus: Wrath of Gods</i></b></p> <p>Fi and Zeke aid Peter in his globe-trotting quest to seek out the remaining Firstborn, uncover the enemy’s plans, and gather the warriors of old. Along the way, Fi and Zeke discover they, too, have strengths of their own - though they come at a cost neither may wish to bear.</p> <p><b>Book 3: </b><b><i>Paternus: War of Gods</i></b></p> <p>From Africa to Asgard, to an invisible island in the Pacific and the Bone Road of a forgotten realm, Fi and Zeke must come to grips with who and what they are - and accept what they are becoming: wielders of ancient and dangerous powers, warriors, and maybe even heroes.</p> <p><b>Cry havoc, and let slip the gods of war.</b></p>";
