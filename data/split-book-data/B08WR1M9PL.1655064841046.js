After untold years living countless lives, Gal begins acting strange. Possessive. Violent. Paranoid.&nbsp;</p> <p>Positive that something in the real world is causing her to malfunction, Will attempts to leave the Great Escape, but he finds himself a prisoner. Guided by a voice from reality, he is thrust into a series of torturous narratives, each one designed to break his will and keep him trapped in virtual reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Betrayed by his digital love, his long-term memory overwritten, and enduring violent manipulation, Will painfully peels back layers of simulation, fighting to reach reality 1.0 - where the nightmares are real.</p> <p>Maybe.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>New York Times</i> and number-one Audible best-selling author Jeremy Robinson takes listeners on a heart-wrenching journey to the edge of the universe and beyond, where distinguishing reality from simulation might be impossible.&nbsp;</p>";
