window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Build a dungeon. Slay heroes. Survive finals.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Wounded Army vet Logan Murray thought mimics were the stuff of board games and dungeon manuals...right up until one ate him.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a flash of snapping teeth, Logan suddenly finds himself on the doorstep to another world. He’s been unwittingly recruited into the Shadowcroft Academy for Dungeons - the most prestigious interdimensional school dedicated to training the monstrous guardians who protect the Tree of Souls from so-called heroes. Heroes who would destroy the universe if it meant a shot at advancement.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as a bottom-tier cultivator with a laughably weak core, Logan’s dungeon options aren’t exactly stellar, and he finds himself reincarnated as a lowly fungaloid, a three-foot-tall mass of spongy mushroom with fewer skills than a typical sewer rat. If he’s going to survive the grueling challenges the academy has in store, he’ll need to ace the odd assortment of classes - Fiendish Fabrication, Dungeon Feng Shui, the Ethics of Murder 101 - and learn how to turn his unusual guardian form into an asset instead of a liability.</p> <p>And that’s only if the gargoyle professor doesn’t demote him to a doomed wandering monster first....</p> <p><b>From James A. Hunter - best-selling author of </b><b><i>Rogue Dungeon</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Bibliomancer (Completionist Chronicles Expanded Universe)</i></b><b>, and the LitRPG epic </b><b><i>Viridian Gate Online</i></b><b> - and Dragon Award-finalist Aaron Michael Ritchey comes a brand-new Dungeon Core novel, like nothing you've ever heard before. Funny, funky, and full of Gamelit goodness, this is one novel you won't want to put down.</b></p>";
