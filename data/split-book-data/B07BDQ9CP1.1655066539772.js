After spending his entire life training, he's finally ready to test his skills in the biggest tournament on Earth, where hundreds of the fiercest competitors vie for the supreme title. </p> <p>In the semifinals, Seth is getting the upper hand when his opponent uses an illegal blow to take him out. Upon waking up from a coma, Seth finds out he's lost his sight. He's become blind, and he's completely devastated. All his dreams are now shattered, and he soon falls into depression. What is he going to do with his life? </p> <p>That's when he's introduced to Bushido Online, a game that promises to keep his skills sharp while he figures out what his next move is going to be. Set in feudal Japan, this VRMMORPG is the land of ninjas and samurai. A world where the most honorable warriors meet the vilest bandits and where mythical creatures roam free.

Thankfully, Seth has a few things going for him: his extensive knowledge of combat and a never-say-die attitude. </p> <p><i>Bushido Online: The Battle Begins</i> is the first book in the Bushido Online series, a work of litRPG fiction. </p> <p>Credit: Cover art by Pindurski </p>";
