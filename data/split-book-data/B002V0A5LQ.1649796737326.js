window.bookSummaryJSON = "Connie Willis' Hugo and Nebula Award-winning <i>Doomsday Book</i> uses time travel for a serious look at how people connect with each other. In this Hugo-winning companion to that novel, she offers a completely different kind of time travel adventure: a delightful romantic comedy that pays hilarious homage to Jerome K. Jerome's <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>. <p> When too many jumps back to 1940 leave 21st century Oxford history student Ned Henry exhausted, a relaxing trip to Victorian England seems the perfect solution. But complexities like recalcitrant rowboats, missing cats, and love at first sight make Ned's holiday anything but restful - to say nothing of the way hideous pieces of Victorian art can jeopardize the entire course of history.</p> <p> Delightfully aided by the perfect comedic timing of narrator Steven Crossley, <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> shows once again why Connie Willis is one of the most talented writers working today.</p>";
