There they discover a collection of old audio tapes that Melissa left behind: a set of clues they must follow if they’re to solve this mystery in time. Insidious forces will stop at nothing to destroy them, and an impossibly ancient menace lurks deep beneath the ground, waiting for the chance to strike....&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an Audible Original Podcast, developed and produced with investment from Screen Queensland.
