window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An existence spent being forced to kill others to satiate a Monster.</p> <p>Where the only thing to look forward to was the blessed, if brief, period of time between paying that bribe.</p> <p>Except that very same Monster is and isn’t Rene.</p> <p>It just happened to live inside his own mind and force him to do what it wanted. Rather than being an actual Monster.</p> <p>That was Rene’s entire life until a fateful day changed that.</p> <p>A day that the career as a hitman for hire built on the Monster’s needs will end. Where Rene will be forced to atone for his actions. To be held accountable and judged.</p> <p>Except the verdict is already long since passed and needs no deliberation.</p> <p>His sentence was being sent hundreds of years into the past, into a different world even, where he must live a life for the betterment of others. Every action judged as it happens and weighed out against him.</p> <p>But even this new idyllic life he’s been living in for 18 years is about to go off the rails and Rene will be forced back into a life lived in the underworld.</p> <p>Armed with a few gifts granted to him by the one who judged him, gifts better suited to a fantasy about living in a video game, Rene has to maneuver his way back to his new life while using all the things he’d learned in his old one.</p> <p>Except using those skills is a double-edged sword. If he’s not careful, he’ll end up right back where he started.</p> <p>Dead and on his way to hell.</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Listen at your own risk.</b></p>";
