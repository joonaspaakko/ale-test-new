window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Crazy has no memory and feels no fear. Dangerous and unpredictable, he's locked away in SafeHaven, a psychiatric hospital, where he spends the long days watching <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> and wondering what the outside world smells like. When a mysterious visitor arrives and offers him a way out Crazy doesn't hesitate to accept. </p> <p>But outside the hospital Crazy is faced with a world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, and finds himself relocated to Neuro Inc., a secretive corporation with strange government ties. When he discovers evidence of human experimentation he escapes with a syringe, the contents of which are unknown to him but precious to Neuro. Cornered and with a complete disregard for the results, Crazy makes himself indispensable by injecting the substance into his leg. </p> <p>As the substance enters his bloodstream, though, his eyes are opened to a world beyond human experience, where fear is a tool and the shadows hide the source of mankind's nightmares. Struggling to understand his new abilities, Crazy allies himself with the company he fled and begins peeling back the layers of his past, the brewing war between worlds, how he can stop it - and what he did to start it. </p> <p>With <i>Mirrorworld</i>, Robinson, whose trademarked pacing and inventive plots have been highly praised by bestselling authors like Jonathan Maberry, Scott Sigler, and James Rollins, treats listeners to a wildly imaginative, frenetically paced thriller exploring the origins of fear.</p>";
