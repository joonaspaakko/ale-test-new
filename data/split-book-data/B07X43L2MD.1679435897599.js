window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>C.A.E.C.O. </i>is book 15 in best-selling author John Conroe's Demon Accords series.</p> <p>Combat is literally her middle name. Chimeric Adaptive Enhanced Combat Operator - but now Caeco Jensen - works for the FBI, building a new life and trying to learn from a painful past. It’s hard to fit in when you are one of a kind, but maybe, just maybe, there’s a place for her in this world. That is, if threats from off planet don’t ruin it first. Forging and protecting a new future with a her unique skillset won’t be easy, maybe almost as hard as making new friends.</p>";
