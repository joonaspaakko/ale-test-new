Once you’re ready to proceed, here’s a glimpse of the road ahead....</p> <p>Shera, the new Head of the Consultant’s Guild, faces more responsibility than she ever asked for. The Guilds are in a state of open war, her Consultants have been forced to relocate from their ancestral home, and Elder cultists plague the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In their tombs, the Great Elders stir.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the sky cracked and more Elders rising than ever before, Shera and her faction of Independent Guilds seek a truce with their Imperialist opponents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But they know that any alliance is a gamble. The Imperialists have appointed Calder Marten to the throne, and history has proven that a single ruler is vulnerable to Elder corruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Even so, Shera and her allies want to bring the division to an end...if the enemy Guilds are willing to cooperate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>And if Calder hasn’t been corrupted already.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>On the seas, a man clings to his own power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In the shadows, a woman fights for peace.</p>";
