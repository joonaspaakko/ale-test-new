window.bookSummaryJSON = "When Runnel leaves his mountain valley to head for the great city of the water mages, he has no idea of his own magical talents. But he soon finds that without meaning to, he complicates and then endangers the lives of everyone he comes to know and care about.

Otherwise, other people might end up paying the price for his mistakes.";
