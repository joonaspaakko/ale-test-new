window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jana DeLeon, the first in a new thriller series. </p> <p>Everyone wondered about Shaye Archer's past. Including Shaye. </p> <p>Shaye Archer's life effectively began the night police found her in an alley, beaten and abused and with no memory of the previous 15 years, not even her name. Nine years later, she's a licensed private investigator with a single goal - to get answers for her clients when there aren't supposed to be any. </p> <p>And maybe, someday, answers for herself. </p> <p>Emma Frederick thought her nightmare was over when she killed her abusive husband, but someone is stalking her and tormenting her with mementos from her past. With no evidence to support her claims, the police dismiss her claims as post-traumatic stress, but Shaye is convinced that someone is deliberately terrorizing Emma...playing a cat and mouse game with only one goal in mind. </p> <p>To kill Emma. </p>";
