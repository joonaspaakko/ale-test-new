I was right about the sorcery, but wrong about everything else.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Rule two: Don't listen to the demon. </b></p> <p>My uncle chose a far deadlier power. He calls creatures of darkness into our world, binds them into service contracts, and sells them to the highest bidder. And I'm supposed to act like I don't know how illegal and dangerous it is.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Rule three: Don't talk to the demon. </b></p> <p>All I had to do was keep my nose out of it. Pretend I didn't find the summoning circle in the basement. Pretend I didn't notice the shadowy being trapped inside it. Pretend I didn't break the rules. But I did, and now it's too late.&nbsp;</p> <p>Make sure to check out the companion series, The Guild Codex: Spellbound, available now, and The Guild Codex: Warped, coauthored by Rob Jacobsen.</p>";
