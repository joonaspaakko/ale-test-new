window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A haunting, richly atmospheric, and deeply suspenseful novel from the acclaimed author of <i>The Enchanted</i> about an investigator who must use her unique insights to find a missing little girl. </p> <p><i>\"Where are you, Madison Culver? Flying with the angels, a silver speck on a wing? Are you dreaming, buried under snow? Or is it possible you are still alive?\"</i> </p> <p>Three years ago, Madison Culver disappeared when her family was choosing a Christmas tree in Oregon's Skookum National Forest. She would be eight years old now - if she has survived. Desperate to find their beloved daughter, certain someone took her, the Culvers turn to Naomi, a private investigator with an uncanny talent for locating the lost and missing. Known to the police and a select group of parents as \"the Child Finder\", Naomi is their last hope. </p> <p>Naomi's methodical search takes her deep into the icy, mysterious forest in the Pacific Northwest and into her own fragmented past. She understands children like Madison because once upon a time, she was a lost girl, too. </p> <p>As Naomi relentlessly pursues and slowly uncovers the truth behind Madison's disappearance, shards of a dark dream pierce the defenses that have protected her, reminding her of a terrible loss she feels but cannot remember. If she finds Madison, will Naomi ultimately unlock the secrets of her own life? </p> <p>Told in the alternating voices of Naomi and a deeply imaginative child, <i>The Child Finder</i> is a breathtaking, exquisitely rendered literary listen about redemption, the line between reality and memories and dreams, and the human capacity to survive. </p>";
