window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some truths are dangerous, certain secrets best concealed, and one story never should have been written at all.</p> <p>Being an unwanted twin in the Imperial line of succession, Farilane became a scholar, adventurer, and in a time when reading was once more forbiddenâ€”a book hunter. Her singular obsession is finding the mythical Book of Brin, a tome not just lost but intentionally buried. Respected and beloved by the Teshlor Knights, not even their legendary skills can protect her for what she finds is more dangerous than what she sought.</p> <p>From the three-time <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Michael J. Sullivan, <i>Farilane </i>is the second novel in the Rise and Fall trilogy. This latest set of stories sits snugly between Legends of the First Empire and the Riyria books (Revelations and Chronicles). With this tale, Michael continues his tradition of unlikely heroes who must rise to the call when history knocks, demanding to be let in. This series will conclude in the summer of 2023 with the release of <i>Esrahaddon</i>, the final piece in a narrative that began in 2008 and contains 19 full-length novels spread across four series.</p>";
