window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Fate of the Fallen</i></b><b> is the start of a brand-new adventure from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Kel Kade.</b></p> <p><i>Not all stories have happy endings.</i></p> <p>Everyone loves Mathias. Naturally, when he discovers it’s his destiny to save the world, he dives in headfirst, pulling his best friend, Aaslo, along for the ride.</p> <p>However, saving the world isn’t as easy, or exciting, as it sounds in the stories. The going gets rough, and folks start to believe their best chance for survival is to surrender to the forces of evil, which isn’t how the prophecy goes. At all. As the list of allies grows thin and the friends find themselves staring death in the face, they must decide how to become the heroes they were destined to be or, failing that, how to survive.</p>";
