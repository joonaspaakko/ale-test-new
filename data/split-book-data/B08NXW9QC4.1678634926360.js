Most people inherit a house, a pet, or money. Max Abaddon wasn’t so lucky. His gramps left him a job that required him to learn that magic was real, and he’d better learn how to use it. Soon....</p> <p>In his new role Max works with a team of eccentric mages based out of a facility called the Atheneum that has for a very long time managed the relationship between the normal world and well everything else.</p> <p>To make matters worse, a string of high-profile murders ensure his transition is not going to be an easy one. Will the team stop the murderer? Is Max unknowingly part of a bigger scheme? Most importantly, will Max be able to have a normal life again and find time for a drink or two at his favorite bar, the Fallen Angel?</p>";
