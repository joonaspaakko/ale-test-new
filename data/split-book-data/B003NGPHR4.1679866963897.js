window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Raine is a sorceress of moderate powers, from an extended family of smugglers and thieves. With a mix of street smarts and magic spells, she can usually take care of herself. But when her friend Quentin, a no-quite-reformed thief, steals and amulet from the home of a powerful necromancer, Raine finds herself wrapped up in more trouble than she cares for. She likes attention as much as the next girl, but having an army of militant goblins hunting her down is not her idea of a good time. The amulet they're after holds limitless power, derived from an ancient, soul-stealing stone. And when Raine takes possession of the item, <i>it</i> takes possession of <i>her</i>.</p> <p>Now her moderate powers are increasing beyond anything she could imagine - but is the resum√© enchancement worth her soul?</p>";
