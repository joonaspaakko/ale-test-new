window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Hair is the award-winning writer of two young adult fiction series, The Aotearo and The Return of Ravana (based on the Vedic epic <i>The Ramayana</i>). <i>Mage’s Blood</i>, the first volume of a series called The Moontide Quartet, is Hair’s first work of adult fantasy. In a starred review of <i>Mage’s Blood</i>, <i>Publisher’s Weekly</i> said, \"This multilayered beginning to the Moontide Quartet plunges listeners into a taut network of intrigue and mystery that tightens with each chapter. Hair portrays a stark and beautiful world breaking apart, with both good and evil characters desperate to reshape it through magic, war, and treachery. This strong debut should draw in fantasy readers of all stripes.\" </p> <p></p> <p>Most of the time the Moontide Bridge lies deep below the sea, but every 12 years the tides sink and the bridge is revealed, its gates open for trade. The Magi are hell-bent on ruling this new world, and for the last two Moontides they have led armies across the bridge on \"crusades of conquest\". Now, the third Moontide is almost here, and this time the people of the East are ready for a fight... but it is three seemingly ordinary people that will decide the fate of the world.</p>";
