window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From his exile from The Seven to his escape from an insidious cult, The Deep tells all in this companion to the hit Prime Video series </b><b><i>The Boys</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>He may be Lord of the Seven Seas, but for The Deep, life has been a tsunami of humiliations and setbacks. After braving the childhood trauma of being the weird kid with gills, Deep rose to the very top, basking in worldwide fame with Earth’s most powerful superheroes. But his public glory masked the disrespect of his teammates who crushed him, day after day. When he found himself patrolling the streets of Sandusky, Ohio, and then swallowed up into the Church of the Collective, Deep realized he had plummeted even deeper than the Mariana Trench.</p> <p>Now, Deep—on the road promoting his memoir, <i>Deeper</i>—is sitting down for a no-holds-barred podcast interview. With his wife, Cassandra, by his side, Deep dives to the very depths of his soul and lays bare everything that has made him the fish-guy he is today.</p> <p><b>Season three of </b><b><i>The Boys</i></b><b> is available now on Prime Video.</b></p>";
