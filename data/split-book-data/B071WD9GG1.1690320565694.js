But when the cardinal vampire of Los Angeles convinces her to go investigate a new vampire-themed stage show, Scarlett quickly finds herself shoulder-deep in sequins, slot machines, and Old World intrigue. </p> <p>The show's creators are vampire celebrities Arthur and Lucy Holmwood, who once inspired characters from the original <i>Dracula</i>.
