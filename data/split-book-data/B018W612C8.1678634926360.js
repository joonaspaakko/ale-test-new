window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Iron Druid Atticus O'Sullivan, hero of Kevin Hearne's epic <i>New York Times</i> best-selling urban fantasy series, has a point to make - and then drive into a vampire's heart. </p> <p>When a druid has lived for 2,000 years like Atticus, he's bound to run afoul of a few vampires. Make that legions of them. Even his former friend and legal counsel turned out to be a bloodsucking backstabber. </p> <p>Now the toothy troublemakers - led by power-mad Theophilus - have become a huge problem requiring a solution. It's time to make a stand. As always, Atticus wouldn't mind a little backup. But his allies have problems of their own. </p> <p>Ill-tempered archdruid Owen Kennedy is having a wee bit of troll trouble: turns out when you stiff a troll, it's not water under the bridge. Meanwhile, Granuaile is desperate to free herself of the Norse god Loki's mark and elude his powers of divination - a quest that will bring her face to face with several Slavic nightmares. </p> <p>As Atticus globetrots to stop his nemesis, Theophilus, the journey leads to Rome. What better place to end an immortal than the Eternal City? But poetic justice won't come without a price: in order to defeat Theophilus, Atticus may have to lose an old friend. </p>";
