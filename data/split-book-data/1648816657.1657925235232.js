window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When things go bump in the night and children go missing, she is the last hope to bring them home.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>“My name is Rylee, and I am a Tracker.”&nbsp;</p> <p>When children go missing, and the humans have no leads, I’m the one they call. I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot. I’m on the FBI’s wanted list. I have a werewolf for a pet and a witch of a best friend and have no need for anyone else in my life. But when a hunt for a missing child starts to spin out of control, help comes from a most unexpected direction. One who is dangerously dark, brooding, and doesn’t know a thing about the supernatural. One whose kisses set me on fire.</p> <p>Performed by Nora Achrati; Chris Genebach; Bradley Smith; Yasmin Tuazon; Alejandro Ruiz; Amanda Forstrom; David Jourdan; Ken Jackson; Nanette Savard; Carolyn Kashner; Eric Messner; Colleen Delany; Kimberly Gilbert; Michael John Casey; Richard Rohan; Nick DePinto; Rose Elizabeth Supan; Mort Shelby; Scott McCormic; Terence Aselford.</p>";
