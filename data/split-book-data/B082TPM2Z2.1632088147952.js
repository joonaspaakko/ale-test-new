window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something has stolen the darkling mage's face.</p> <p>Reports of arcane theft and violence are pouring in from all over Valero. They all have one thing in common: a perpetrator who looks exactly like Dustin Graves. But Dust has been hanging in the hideout, barely out of sight of his bloodthirsty companions.</p> <p>An impostor is clearly on the prowl, and soon a vampire clan, the Lorica, and even Dust's own allies are giving him hell for crimes he didn't commit. There's also the matter of finding an entity powerful enough to reforge Vanitas. But the darkling mage will pull through. Dustin always does. Well...except when he doesn't.</p> <p>If you like snarky heroes, snappy dialogue, and a bit of grit and gore, you'll love the third book in Nazri Noor's series of urban fantasy novels. Explore the Darkling Mage universe and discover <i>Grave Intentions </i>today.</p>";
