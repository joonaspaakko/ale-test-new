When it comes to finding cheating spouses, corporate thieves, or runaway teenagers, he’s unenthusiastic, and unmatched. As a former San Francisco detective, he misses more meaningful work, but he hasn’t had the heart for it since his wife’s death five years prior. That is, until a phone call from a distraught mother, an illegal immigrant who can’t go to the police, puts him on the hunt for a missing little girl.</p> <p>By the time he reaches the mother’s small home, she’s missing, too. The circumstances are strange, but when a team of heavily armed mercenaries arrive, Delgado is convinced there is more going on than a simple kidnapping.</p> <p>Joined by his wise-cracking elderly assistant, a gun-toting pastor, and a UFO enthusiast Uber driver, Delgado follows the clues west, to Colorado City, a town cleaved in two by the 37th parallel, also known as the UFO Highway. In a town infamous for fundamentalist Mormon cult activity, they uncover evidence of a massive child-trafficking ring whose ringleaders might not be human.</p> <p>Delgado and crew are plunged into a dangerous world of corporate competition, UFO lore, and government cover-ups. While they hunt for answers, they’re pursued across the Southwest by high-tech mercs, brainwashed cults, and beings whose true identity has been concealed since 1947.</p> <p><b>...he must risk the world.</b></p> <p>UFOs and alien abductions remain some of the most hotly debated and mysterious subjects of the 21st century. In the decades since 1960, with reports of strange encounters on the rise, 13 million people have gone missing worldwide and never been found. <i>The Others</i> takes a fast-paced, unique, and moving look at the phenomenon that has fueled Jeremy Robinson’s imagination since several sightings, strange happenings, and visits with renowned UFO investigator and family friend Raymond Fowler.&nbsp;</p>";
