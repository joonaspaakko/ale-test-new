Nameless has only a gun, missions from a shadowy agency, and one dead aim: dispense justice when the law fails. As he moves from town to town, driven by splintered visions of the past and future, he's headed toward the ultimate confrontation in this propulsive series of short thrillers by number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Dean Koontz. With narration by Edoardo Ballerini.</p>";
