window.bookSummaryJSON = "The multiple-award-winning science-fiction master returns to the universe that is his greatest triumph - the world of <i>Hyperion</i> and <i>The Fall ofHyperion</i> - with a novel even more magnificent than its predecessors. <p>Dan Simmons's <i>Hyperion</i> was an immediate sensation on its first publication in 1989. This staggering multifaceted tale of the far future heralded the conquest of the science-fiction field by a man who had already won the World Fantasy Award for his first novel (<i>Song of Kali</i>) and had also published one of the most well-received horror novels in the field, <i>Carrion Comfort</i>. <i>Hyperion</i> went on to win the Hugo Award as Best Novel, and it and its companion volume, <i>The Fall of Hyperion</i>, took their rightful places in the science-fiction pantheon of new classics.</p> <p>Here, Simmons returns to this richly imagined world of technological achievement, excitement, wonder and fear. <i>Endymion</i> is a story about love and memory, triumph and terror - an instant candidate for the field's highest honors.</p>";
