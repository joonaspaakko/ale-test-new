Dick, but through a narrative that slowly unfolds upon a scale closer to that of <i>Dune</i> or <i>The Expanse</i>. But at the heart of <i>First of Their Kind</i>, you will experience the hopes and dreams of the first synthetic intelligences; the first SI. The story is through their eyes.</p> <p><i>First of Their Kind</i> is the first novel of Two Doctors Media Collaborative transformed into audio form; look for <i>Their Greatest Game</i>, its sequel.</p>";
