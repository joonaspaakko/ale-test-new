window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Steven Erikson continues the beloved Malazan Book of the Fallen with this first book in the thrilling Witness sequel trilogy, </b><b><i>The God is Not Willing</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Many years have passed since three warriors brought carnage and chaos to Silver Lake.</p> <p>Now the tribes of the north no longer venture into the southlands. The town has recovered and yet the legacy remains.&nbsp;</p> <p>Responding to reports of a growing unease among the tribes beyond the border, the Malazan army marches on the new god’s people. They aren't quite sure what they're going to be facing.</p> <p>And in those high mountains, a new warleader has risen amongst the Teblor. Scarred by the deeds of Karsa Orlong, he intends to confront his god even if he has to cut a bloody swathe through the Malazan Empire to do so.</p> <p>Further north, a new threat has emerged and now it seems it is the Teblor who are running out of time. Another long-feared migration is about to begin and this time it won't just be three warriors. No, this time tens of thousands are poised to pour into the lands to the south. And in their way, a single company of Malazan marines . . .</p>";
