It is the home of the most implacable enemies that humanity, in all its interstellar expansion, has ever encountered. <p>Felix is a scout in A-team Two. Highly competent, he is the sole survivor of mission after mission. Yet he is a man consumed by fear and hatred. And he is protected not only by his custom-fitted body armor, the culmination of 10,000 years of the armorers' craft, but also by an odd being which seems to live with him, a cold killing machine he calls \"the Engine.\"</p>";
