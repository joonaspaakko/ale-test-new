window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For nearly two thousand years, there was only one Druid left walking the Earth - Atticus O'Sullivan, the Iron Druid, whose sharp wit and sharp sword kept him alive while pursued by a pantheon of hostile deities. Now he's got company. Atticus's apprentice Granuaile is finally a full Druid herself. What's more, Atticus has defrosted an archdruid long ago frozen in time, a father figure (of sorts) who now goes by the modern name Owen Kennedy. And Owen has some catching up to do.</p> <p>Atticus takes pleasure in the role reversal, as the student is now the teacher. Between busting Atticus's chops and trying to fathom a cell phone, Owen must also learn English. For Atticus, the jury's still out on whether the wily old coot will be an asset in the epic battle with Norse god Loki - or merely a pain in the arse. As the trio of Druids deals with pestilence-spreading demons, bacon-loving yeti, fierce flying foxes, and frenzied Fae, they're hoping that this time...three's a charm.</p> <p>The Iron Druid Chronicles:</p> <p><i>Hounded </i></p> <p><i>Hexed </i></p> <p><i>Hammered</i></p> <p><i>Tricked</i></p> <p><i>Trapped</i></p> <p><i>Hunted</i></p> <p><i>Shattered</i></p> <p><i>Staked</i></p> <p><i>Scourged</i></p> <p><i>Besieged (short stories)</i></p>";
