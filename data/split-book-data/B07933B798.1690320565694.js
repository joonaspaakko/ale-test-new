window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Trained from birth in swordplay and combat, a young knight named Siris has journeyed to the Dark Citadel with a single purpose: fight through the army of Titans to face the tyrannical God King in one-on-one combat. This was his father's sacred mission, and his father's before him, going back countless generations in an effort to free their people from enslavement.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when Siris somehow succeeds where all those from his bloodline previously have failed, he finds himself cast into a much larger world, filled with warriors and thieves, ancient feuds and shifting alliances, Deathless immortals and would-be kings. His quest for freedom will take him on an epic journey in search of the mythical figure known as the Worker of Secrets - the one being in the world who can unravel the secrets of the Infinity Blade.&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on the best-selling video game from ChAIR Entertainment and Epic Games, this all-new adventure from acclaimed fantasy author Brandon Sanderson digs deeper into the fantastical world of Infinity Blade, a world of mystery and intrigue where magic and technology are indistinguishable, and even life and death are not what they seem.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brandon Sanderson has published six solo novels with Tor Books - <i>Elantris</i>, the Mistborn trilogy, <i>Warbreaker</i>, and <i>The Way of Kings </i>- as well as four books in the middle-grade Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians series from Scholastic. He was chosen to complete Robert Jordan's long-running Wheel of Time series, to which he added 2009's <i>The Gathering Storm</i> and 2010's <i>Towers of Midnight</i>, as well as the final book in the series, <i>A Memory of Light</i>, in 2012. Currently living in Utah with his wife and children, Brandon teaches creative writing at Brigham Young University.</p>";
