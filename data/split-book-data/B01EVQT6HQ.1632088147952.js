window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A mind-bending, classic Philip K. Dick novel about the perception of reality. </b></p> <p><b>Named as one of <i>Time</i>'s 100 best books.</b> </p> <p>Glen Runciter runs a lucrative business - deploying his teams of anti-psychics to corporate clients who want privacy and security from psychic spies. But when he and his top team are ambushed by a rival, he is gravely injured and placed in \"half-life,\" a dreamlike state of suspended animation. Soon, though, the surviving members of the team begin experiencing some strange phenomena, such as Runciter's face appearing on coins and the world seeming to move backward in time. As consumables deteriorate and technology gets ever more primitive, the group needs to find out what is causing the shifts and what a mysterious product called Ubik has to do with it all. </p>";
