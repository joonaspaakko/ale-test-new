window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When magic is up, electricity dies, cars stall, and skyscrapers tumble; when it's down, phones and guns work, and defensive spells can't protect your house from the creatures who stalk the streets. Equally dangerous are the competing factions of The Pack - a highly organized and military clan who governs Atlanta's were-bears, -wolves, and -hyenas - versus the Masters of the Dead, power and knowledge-hungry necromancers whose minds control hordes of blood-crazed vampires. </p> <p>This is home to Kate Daniels, a mercenary who investigates when things get out of hand. Kate likes her sword a little too much and has a hard time controlling her mouth. But when her guardian is murdered, she must choose between doing nothing and staying safe, or pursuing the dangerous entity who killed him. Kate is way out of her league; but who ever said the right choice was easy? </p>";
