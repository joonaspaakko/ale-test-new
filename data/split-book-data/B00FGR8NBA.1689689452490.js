I was once an orphaned kitchen boy, with no family and no prospects, but I am destined to become a master magicianâ€¦. </p> <p>War is coming to the Kingdom of the Isles from another world, bringing with it chaos and destruction. Pug yearns to train as a warrior and fight for his kingdom alongside his foster-brother, Tomas, but instead he is forced to follow a different path: a path that will lead him right into the heart of the enemy.
