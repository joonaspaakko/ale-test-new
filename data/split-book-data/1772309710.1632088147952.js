window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Thomas was no one, an orphan with no past and no memories of his early life. The only clue lies in the strange birthmark on his chest, a mark that may or may not reveal his origin, but will certainly guide him to his destiny.&nbsp;</p> <p>Growing to manhood he will become a man of consequence and influence, yet the greatest gift he has to offer his people lies not in his power, but in his wisdom. As he strives to reach his potential he will face obstacles great and small and he will discover that some foes are too strong to defeat with power alone.&nbsp;</p> <p>The greatest of evils can only be stopped when those true of heart are willing to sacrifice blood, tears, and sometimes - their lives.</p>";
