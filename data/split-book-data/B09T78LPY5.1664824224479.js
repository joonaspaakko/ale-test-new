window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After a brush with death at the tender age of nine, Faer Michelson has a near-perfect autobiographical memory. He has a good life, a loving wife, and he's only mildly concerned about Y2K. Sure, no one else remembers Bobby Kennedy was president or that time an alien took over the TV to declare war, but what's that in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp;</p> <p>Then one day Faer remembers something that he can't shrug off: his own death in 1968.</p> <p>It turns out the Time Warp isn't just a song in <i>Rocky Horror</i>. Faer finds himself stranded in the past with a shape-shifting alien and an apparition of his best friend. An unearthly decree is made before Faer can sort out how to get home: Save yourself, then save the world.</p> <p><i>Tear in Time</i> is an adult speculative fiction novel.</p>";
