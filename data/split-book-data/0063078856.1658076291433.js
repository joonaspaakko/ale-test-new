When his father Montrose goes missing, 22-year-old Army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New England to find him, accompanied by his Uncle George—publisher of&nbsp;<i>The Safe Negro Travel Guide</i>—and his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite—heir to the estate that owned one of Atticus’s ancestors—they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours.</p> <p>A chimerical blend of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse members of two black families,&nbsp;<i>Lovecraft Country</i>&nbsp;is a devastating kaleidoscopic portrait of racism—the terrifying specter that continues to haunt us today.</p>";
