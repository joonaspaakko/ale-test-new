window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Playing fast and loose with the Order's rules has finally caught up with me. </p> <p>Sentenced to hunt down a cagey insurgent known as the Death Mage, I'm not feeling overly optimistic. Wizards with far more experience have tried and, well...died. </p> <p>But overmatched or not, I want this assignment. The Death Mage killed my mother - he might also be my father. </p> <p>I can't lose my head, though. The mage wields an evil, mind-warping magic. A power that undermines his victims' sanity while pledging their souls to an ancient being and devourer of worlds. </p> <p>How would I even know if his magic was corrupting me? </p> <p>Or is it already? </p>";
