Joining with the Free Traders, a league of merchant princes, Thorby must find the courage to live by his wits and fight his way up from society's lowest rung. But Thorby's destiny will be forever changed when he discovers the truth about his own identity.</p> <p><i>Citizen of the Galaxy</i> is a suspenseful tale of adventure, coming of age, and interstellar conflict by science fiction's Grand Master.</p>";
