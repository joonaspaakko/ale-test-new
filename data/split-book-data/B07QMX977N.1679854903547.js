window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Betrayal cuts deepest when someone you love wields the knife.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Kellik, a once-rising star of Port Gloom's guild of thieves, it also leaves him floating in the bay, bleeding out and without hope or allies. Saved by an urchin and healed by a disgraced saint, Kellick is consumed by a single desire: to find out why his guild master ordered him cut down moments after passing his initiation trial.&nbsp;</p> <p>Burning with injustice, Kellik recruits a number of gorgeous rogues to his side: fallen assassins, dark elf witches, and unnervingly polite necromancers. Together they journey through the shadowy underbelly of Port Gloom in pursuit of bloody revenge, daring to face impossible odds and uncover the grim truth: not only the reason for the guild's unnatural monopoly on crime, but why his guild master might have been justified in ordering his death after all.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoilers: </b><i>Rise of the Shadow Rogue</i> is an 18+ audiobook intended for mature listeners. It contains graphic sex, medieval violence, and nudity. People swear, betray their loved ones, set each other on fire, seduce each other, and are scared witless by abysmal horrors. Most importantly, you'll meet gorgeous, powerful women, some capable of twisting the very fabric of fate, others of tearing a man in half with their bare hands. All are willing to enter unconventional, polyamorous harem relationships if it means helping Kellik achieve justice, and with this many powerful women on his side, he just might stand a chance.</p>";
