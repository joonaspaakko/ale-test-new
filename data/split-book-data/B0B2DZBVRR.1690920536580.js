window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audible’s bold new addition to the Sherlock Holmes universe, <i>Moriarty: The Devils Game</i>, dares to ask: What if Holmes’ most villainous nemesis was actually an innocent man?</p> <p>Featuring Dominic Monaghan (<i>Lord of the Rings, Lost</i>) in a riveting lead performance, Moriarty turns one of literature’s most famous rivalries on its head, recasting Professor James Moriarty as a desperate fugitive framed for murder–and hunted by dark forces who will stop at nothing to exploit his brilliance.</p> <p>Moriarty finds the professor on the heels of an earth-shattering mathematical breakthrough–a formula so powerful, it can predict the future–and at the scene of a gruesome murder he must solve to prove his innocence. With London’s sprawling underworld as their battleground, Moriarty and Holmes match their peerless intellects to gain the ever-shifting upper hand. But as their duel escalates, so does the deadly cost of pursuing the truth. “What will it take to get your justice?” Dr. Watson asks an utterly ensnared Moriarty, “And if you do get it… what will you become?”</p> <p>Vividly brought to life by a sensational cast and meticulously crafted sound design, <i>Moriarty</i> is a heart-pounding series filled with biting wit and shocking twists at every turn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Listen closely–and assume nothing. The game is afoot.</p>";
