window.bookSummaryJSON = "The paths of treachery lead Sharpe's company to join the army of Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, to take on the Mahratta horde. Sharpe must survive the carnage and live to tell the tale of what will be remembered as one of the greatest battles of the 19th century. <p>With the return of the brave English sergeant Richard Sharpe, set to battle the mercenary forces of the Mahratta confederation in India, Bernard Cornwell claims his rightful place among the masters of historical narrative. <i>Sharpe's Triumph</i> is a riveting story of betrayal and revenge that, like each new installment in the Sharpe series, was an immediate best seller around the world.</p>";
