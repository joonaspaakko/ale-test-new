window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Best Seller</b></p> <p><b>The specter of graduation looms large as Naomi Novik’s groundbreaking, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling trilogy continues</b> <b>in the stunning sequel to </b><b><i>A Deadly Education</i></b><b>.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>In Wisdom, Shelter.</i> That’s the official motto of the Scholomance. I suppose you could even argue that it’s true - only the wisdom is hard to come by, so the shelter’s rather scant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Our beloved school does its best to devour all its students - but now that I’ve reached my senior year and have actually won myself a handful of allies, it’s suddenly developed a very particular craving for me. And even if I somehow make it through the endless waves of maleficaria that it keeps throwing at me in between grueling homework assignments, I haven’t any idea how my allies and I are going to make it through the graduation hall alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Unless, of course, I finally accept my foretold destiny of dark sorcery and destruction. That would certainly let me sail straight out of here. The course of wisdom, surely.&nbsp;</p> <p>But I’m not giving in - not to the mals, not to fate, and especially not to the Scholomance. I’m going to get myself and my friends out of this hideous place for good - even if it’s the&nbsp;last&nbsp;thing I do.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>With keen insight and mordant humor, Novik reminds us that sometimes it is not enough to rewrite the rules - sometimes, you need to toss out the entire rulebook.</b></p> <p><b>The magic of the Scholomance trilogy will continue in 2022.</b></p>";
