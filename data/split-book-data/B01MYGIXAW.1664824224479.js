window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A space adventure set on a lone ship where the clones of a murdered crew must find their murderer - before they kill again. </p> <p>It was not common to awaken in a cloning vat streaked with drying blood. </p> <p>At least Maria Arena had never experienced it. She had no memory of how she died. That was also new; before, when she had awakened as a new clone, her first memory was of how she died. Maria's vat was in the front of six vats, each one holding the clone of a crew member of the starship <i>Dormire</i>, each clone waiting for its previous incarnation to die so it could awaken. And Maria wasn't the only one to die recently.... </p>";
