window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They thought the fae were a myth....</p> <p>They were wrong.</p> <p>As the son of a mere merchant, Klöss wants nothing more than to pass his trials and join the ranks of the Bjornmen raiders, breaking free of his father and following in the footsteps of his forefathers. But times are changing in the Barren Isles. The centuries-old tradition of coastal plunder is making way for outright conquest, and the threat of war is looming.</p> <p>Found abandoned in the forests of Anlan, Devin leads a simple life. But fate, it seems, has other plans. As his sleepy village transforms in the face of foreign invaders, whispered rumours tell of creatures in the moonlight, shadowy figures with eyes of amber flame. The fae are returning to Haven, and vengeance is within their grasp.</p> <p>As the first battles rage between Anlan and the Bjornmen invaders, only one man seems to know the true threat facing the world of Haven, but can Devin or Klöss convince anyone before it is too late?</p> <p>A reluctant coming of age epic set in a fantasy world. Packed with heroic sword fights, fierce battles and the political schemes of two worlds, The Riven Wyrde Saga is perfect for fans of Patrick Rothfuss, Peter V. Brett, and Brandon Sanderson.
