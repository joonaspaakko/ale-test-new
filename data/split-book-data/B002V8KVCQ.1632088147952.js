window.bookSummaryJSON = "John Taylor's the name. I'm a PI, working that small slice of mystical real estate in the hidden centre of London that's called the Nightside. It's a place where the sun refuses to rise, where monsters and men walk side by side, and where you can fulfill your every dark and depraved desire. What I do there, better than anybody else alive (or dead) is find things - for the right client, for the right price. My new client can certainly afford me. <p>The editor of the Unnatural Inquirer, the Nightside's most notorious gossip rag (the one everyone pretends not to read), has offered me more than one million pounds to find a man named Pen Donavon, who claims to have evidence of the Afterlife - picked up on a television broadcast and burned onto DVD. The Inquirer made Donavon a sweet deal for exclusive rights. Then both he and the disc vanished. I don't know if the disc is on the level, but a job's a job (and a million pounds is a million pounds). Trouble is, not only are all of the usual suspects pretty dangerous individuals, but it's beginning to look like someone else - someone very powerful - is on the trail, too. And who - or what - ever it is, is deadly determined to find the disc first.</p>";
