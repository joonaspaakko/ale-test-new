Yes, there were times when it was extremely cool, but when the newness of it all wore off, Annie Collins was left with a permanent security detail and the kind of constant scrutiny that makes the college experience especially awkward.</p> <p>Not helping matters: she’s the only kid in school with her own pet spaceship.</p> <p>She would love it if things found some kind of normal, but as long as she has control of the most lethal - and only - interstellar vehicle in existence, that isn’t going to happen. Worse, things appear to be going in the other direction. Instead of everyone getting used to the idea of the ship, the complaints are getting louder. Public opinion is turning, and the demands that Annie turn over the ship are becoming more frequent. It doesn’t help that everyone seems to think Annie is giving them nightmares.</p> <p>Nightmares aren’t the only weird things going on lately. A government telescope in California has been abandoned, and nobody seems to know why.</p> <p>The man called on to investigate - Edgar Somerville - has become the go-to guy whenever there’s something odd going on, which has been pretty common lately. So far, nothing has panned out: no aliens or zombies or anything else that might be deemed legitimately peculiar...but now may be different, and not just because Ed can’t find an easy explanation. This isn’t the only telescope where people have gone missing, and the clues left behind lead back to Annie.</p> <p>It all adds up to a new threat that the world may just need saving from, requiring the help of all the Sorrow Falls survivors.

An army of dragons advance. And the fate of the living rests with the dead. </b></p> <p>After obtaining the secret to creating dragons, the leader of the Fhrey has turned the tide of war once more - but gaining the advantage has come at a terrible price. While Imaly plots to overthrow the fane for transgressions against his people, a mystic and a keeper are the only hope for the Rhunes. Time is short, and the future of both races hangs in the balance. In this exciting conclusion to the Legends of the First Empire series, the Great War finally comes to a climactic end, and with it dawns a new era in the Age of Empyre.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today </i>best-selling author Michael J. Sullivan comes the concluding installment of his six-book epic fantasy. This series chronicles a pivotal point in Elan's history when humans and those they once saw as gods warred until a new world order was born. Set 3,000 years before the Riyria tales, Legends is a stand-alone fantasy series that is independent of the Riyria novels. But for those who do listen to both series, Legends will unmask lies and reveal the truth about Elan's history and the men and women who shaped what the world became.</p>","title":"Age of Empyre","titleShort":"Age of Empyre"},{"added":543,"asin":"B073PG4DX8","authors":[{"name":"Luke Chmilenko","url":"B01LZ2769R"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"cover":"51K+pmPu7YL","dateAdded":"2020-10-15","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"17h 56m ","narrators":[{"name":"Luke Daniels"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Podium Audio"}],"rating":4.7,"ratings":13416,"releaseDate":"2017-07-18","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/podm/000452/bk_podm_000452_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B092LDSCG2","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"Ascend Online [chronological order]"},{"asin":"B073R57497","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"Ascend Online [publication order]"}],"title":"Ascend Online: Ascend Online, Book 1","titleShort":"Ascend Online"},{"added":542,"asin":"B01NH0D987","authors":[{"name":"Ursula K.

an interstellar incident when he kills an alien diplomat in a most unusual way. To avoid war, Earth's government must find an equally unusual object: A type of sheep (\"The Android's Dream\"), used in the alien race's coronation ceremony. </p> <p>To find the sheep, the government turns to Harry Creek, ex-cop, war hero and hacker extraordinaire, who with the help of Brian Javna, a childhood friend turned artificial intelligence, scours the earth looking for the rare creature. And they find it, in the unknowing form of Robin Baker, pet store owner, whose genes contain traces of the sheep DNA. But there are others with plans for the sheep as well: Mercenaries employed by the military. Adherents of a secret religion based on the writings of a 21st century science-fiction author.

Cure a reptile dysfunction.</b></p> <p>My name is Nate Temple, and I’m secretly a wizard. I ride a foul-mouthed unicorn, drink with Achilles, and am pals with the Four Horsemen. I’ve even cow tipped the Minotaur. I understand the theory of following the rules. I’m just not very good at the application.</p> <p>Because, rules were meant to be broken. Especially when I find out a monster just murdered my parents.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now all I can hear is the sweet, soothing song of vengeance in my ears, playing on repeat.</p> <p>But when shifter dragons come to town, I’m forced to step away from hunting down the scumbag murderer. Because, I know the cure for a reptile dysfunction and the dragons aren’t going to like it.</p> <p>This fight soon opens up Pandora’s Box, and suddenly, every flavor of supernatural thug is after me. The only way out of it - to save my city - is to murder my best friend.</p> <p>I didn’t want, ask for, or start any of this. But I will <i>finish</i> it. It’s time I show St. Louis that magic is very, very real. And that an angry wizard is truly something to see - at least once in your life.

Ninjas. Anthropomorphic musk oxen from the moons of Gartosh. Welcome to the gut-busting universe of Duke LaGrange!&nbsp;</b></p> <p>When bounty hunter Duke LaGrange and his oft-inebriated Japanese-Irish ninja companion, Ishiro’shea, entered their favorite watering hole, Cyborg Joe’s Grill N’ Go &amp; The Why Not Saloon, they had no idea that they would soon be gobbled up by an unhinged astral anomaly and deposited on an uncharted primitive world. Few things are worse than undeveloped planets, especially those that haven’t even made it to the soufflé stage.

But it’s a new, escalating series of mass slayings that has become her latest obsession at Homicide.</p> <p>At first, Jude and her partner, Detective Uriah Ashby, can see no pattern to the seemingly random methods, the crime scenes, or the victims - until they’re approached by a brilliantly compulsive math professor. He believes that the madman’s next move is not incalculable; in fact, it’s all part of a sequential and ingenious numerical riddle. His theory is adding up. The body count is rising.</p> <p>But when the latest victim is found in Jude’s apartment, the puzzle comes with a personal twist that’s going to test the breaking point of her already-fragile state of mind. For all she knows, her number may be up.</p>","title":"The Body Counter: Detective Jude Fontaine Mysteries, Book 2","titleShort":"The Body Counter"},{"added":303,"asin":"B07D1B9SD5","authors":[{"name":"Les Bohem","url":"B07NDN8TYQ"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"61qk+C5UkaL","dateAdded":"2019-07-23","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"10h 37m ","narrators":[{"name":"John Waters"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"rating":3.3,"ratings":15138,"releaseDate":"2019-02-28","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000072/or_orig_000072_sample.mp3","series":null,"title":"Junk","titleShort":"Junk"},{"added":302,"asin":"B01NBWWKVN","authors":[{"name":"R.

But not for horror novelist Rix Usher. Years ago he fled the isolated family estate of Usherland in the menacing North Carolina hills to pursue his writing career. He promised never to return. But his father's impending death has brought Rix back home to assume the role of Usher patriarch - and face his worst fears. </p> <p>His arrival forces him to confront a devious and impassive family and his vulnerable sister's slow descent into insanity. Stirring memories of the grim folktales born out of the surrounding Briartop Mountains and the terrifying legends of missing children, Rix knows that in the dark, twisted corridors of Usherland, that dreadful something he saw as a young boy is still there. It's waiting for him, as decayed and undying as the Usher heritage and more depraved than anything Poe could have imagined. </p> <p>This eerie novel by the Bram Stoker Award-winning author of <i>Swan Song</i> and <i>Boy's Life</i> is \"a frightening pleasure\" and a worthy tribute to the master who inspired it (<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>). </p>","title":"Usher's Passing","titleShort":"Usher's Passing"},{"added":297,"asin":"B07PFRV92D","authors":[{"name":"Brett Battles","url":"B001I9W7PI"}],"categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"cover":"41nwIHw-I-L","dateAdded":"2019-07-18","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"8h 9m ","narrators":[{"name":"Zach Villa"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"rating":4.3,"ratings":2147,"releaseDate":"2019-04-02","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/051875/bk_adbl_051875_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B0892TJCKL","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"The Night Man Chronicles"}],"title":"Night Man: The Night Man Chronicles, Book 1","titleShort":"Night Man"},{"added":296,"asin":"B015WUR7DK","authors":[{"name":"Allen Eskens","url":"B00J0PLMJY"}],"categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"cover":"51eQVD6QYBL","dateAdded":"2019-07-18","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"9h 21m ","narrators":[{"name":"Jonathan Yen"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"rating":4.2,"ratings":3636,"releaseDate":"2015-10-06","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/005255/bk_tant_005255_sample.mp3","series":null,"title":"The Guise of Another","titleShort":"The Guise of Another"},{"added":295,"asin":"0062867164","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Estep","url":"B001IQXFDO"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51jqiWGIfBL","dateAdded":"2019-07-16","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"13h 4m ","narrators":[{"name":"Lauren Fortgang"}],"publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"rating":4.5,"ratings":1459,"releaseDate":"2018-10-02","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/007913/bk_harp_007913_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B07G392QK4","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"A Gargoyle Queen Novel"}],"title":"Kill the Queen: Crown of Shards Series, Book 1","titleShort":"Kill the Queen"},{"added":294,"asin":"B003VKWQIA","authors":[{"name":"Ilona Andrews","url":"/search"},{"name":"Jim Butcher","url":"/search"},{"name":"Shannon K Butcher","url":"/search"},{"name":"Rachel Caine","url":"B001ILHJEA"},{"name":"P.

Now a rogue vampire is killing the weak and defenseless in his city, and no one else seems to care enough to stop him. To end the slaughter, Colin has agreed to take up his sword one last time...but will this \"one final job\" be the death of him?</i> </p> <p><b><i>Blood Scent: A Junkyard Druid Urban Fantasy Novella</i></b> </p> <p>Colin's life has finally regained some semblance of normalcy after the death of his girlfriend, Jesse. He no longer hunts supernatural creatures. He has a job working in his uncle's salvage yard that he enjoys. He's even planning to start college in the fall. </p> <p>And, he lives inside six acres of scrap iron, steel, and magical wards that keep the fae and other denizens of Austin's paranormal underworld far, far away from him. </p> <p>Which is just how he likes it. </p> <p>So when he runs across a rogue vampire on the hunt, his first instinct is to report it to the local coven leader and then mind his own business. But Colin just can't stand aside and watch as innocent people are slaughtered. </p> <p>Which is why he'll take up his sword one last time for one final job. But with witches, doppelgangers, and demigods involved, this gig is turning out to be a lot more complicated and dangerous than he expected. </p> <p>Hopefully, this \"one last job\" won't truly become his last.... </p> <p><i>(Note to listeners: The events in this 30,000 word novella occur before Junkyard Druid.

Becoming a permanent addition to a game world, it doesn't take long to learn that people with his abilities are actively hunted. In fact, if the wrong people gained knowledge of what he was capable of, assassins would appear in droves.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his pursuit of power, Joe fights alongside his team, completes quests, and delves into the mysteries of his class, which he quickly discovers can be practiced only in secret. Ultimately, his goal is to complete every mission, master every ability, and learn all of the world's secrets.

While his cousins were learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family, Danny worried that he would never show a talent, never form an \"outself\". </p> <p>He grew up in the rambling old house, filled with dozens of cousins and aunts and uncles, all ruled by his father. Their home was isolated in the mountains of western Virginia, far from town, far from schools, far from other people. </p> <p>There are many secrets in the House, and many rules that Danny must follow. There is a secret library with only a few dozen books, and none of them in English - but Danny and his cousins are expected to become fluent in the language of the books. While Danny’s cousins are free to create magic whenever they like, they must never do it where outsiders might see. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there are some secrets kept from Danny as well. And that will lead to disaster for the North family. </p> <p>Orson Scott Card, a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, has won several Hugo and Nebula Awards for his works of speculative fiction.
